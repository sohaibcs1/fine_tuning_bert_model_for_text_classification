Color Scheme, Love the app - must be the best and simplest streaming client for Android out there. However - after updating to 0.7.1 I no longer see the option to switch to the dark theme. Any help?,
Color Scheme,dark mode not working.  ,
Color Scheme, Needs updating and a bit more customization on the themes ,
Color Scheme,a dark theme would be great,
Color Scheme,It is good plus it have dark theme - but I can't open it as shortcut from my camera app. please fix this.,
Color Scheme, High fidelity Command and Conquer tunes in my pocket - rendered with any soundfonts I please. Fantastic. Dark theme is a good option. Dear dev - please implement a player control launcher widget.. my only wish from this fine app.,
Color Scheme,Plz apply dark theme cuz bright theme is consuming more battery thanks,
Color Scheme,Font color s messed up after changing to night mode.,
Color Scheme,Love dark theme,
Color Scheme,wherr is the dark mode,
Color Scheme,does this android version have a Contrast control.. ?? most of my films need it. not Brightness control..,
Color Scheme,Please give font size option and make it in black colour,
Color Scheme, This is great. Only suggestion is a dark theme or transparency.,
Color Scheme,nice app - Server runs fine and easy but need for dark theme,
Color Scheme,Where is dark mode?,
Color Scheme,This app is a sick start! Works well - but: no dark theme - tells me it ,
Color Scheme,Decent app - could use some more features. One of which a dark theme since ,
Color Scheme,Amoled black theme please,
Color Scheme,hey where did the dark theme go?,
Color Scheme,Add dark theme,
Color Scheme,Would be perfect if it were possible to choose white or black for the widget - unfortunately my wallpapers are all rather dark and it's hard to see the widget numbers because they're black. Can't find any option to change this.,
Color Scheme, The white on transparent widget is terribly hard to see - and the widget is how I use the app.,
Color Scheme, Please make a darker color graph on light mode theme - thanks,
Color Scheme, Some features need to make a comeback. Transparency - dark theme!,
Color Scheme, The calculator is all black...I have a dark background. Please fix and I'll reinstall it.,
Color Scheme, No ads - turns your phone into a decent scientific calculator. The light theme is more visually appealing IMO.,
Color Scheme, Widget is no longer in white. Have a dark theme & the black numbers are not visible.,
Color Scheme,White theme is gone?,
Color Scheme,Please make thread watcher in a dark theme,
Color Scheme,This app is amazing but I discovered just one problem with the light theme. It makes the status bar - where the battery percentage along with other notifications is shown - invisible. I'm running the app on Lollipop.,
Color Scheme, Dark theme please,
Color Scheme, Could you add a dark theme as well?,
Color Scheme, Maybe you could add options for light and dark theme. Thanks,
Color Scheme, Can I request for dark theme mode?,
Color Scheme, This is the other Facebook app I use. It's good - but doesn't have a dark theme. That's one thing it needs.,
Color Scheme, Tiny - fast and sufficient! Now if it only had a choice between dark or light theme - then I would be totally complete.,
Color Scheme, A white theme option would be nice,
Color Scheme,Fast. Simple. Dark theme. Excellent!,
Color Scheme, Just make dark theme default.,
Color Scheme, But the yellow theme is a big strain on the eyes - and the dark one is just too dark. Please consider adding a couple of colors. Thanks,
Color Scheme, Yellow isn't the most pleasant color to look at - in my opinion. Night mode would be appreciated for reduced eye strain,
Color Scheme,Great app - but as many others have said - the new update's color should be adjustable or ay least a color besides light purple,
Color Scheme, Personally I'm not a fan of the update. I liked the darker color of the screens instead of a blinding white - and the life counter seems to visibly refresh every minutes when in use. I am also saddened to see the card images disappear. That was a helpful feature that helped me determine how old a card actually was.,
Color Scheme,Excellent app! Dark theme can be enhanced.,
Color Scheme,I reviewed alot of apps - this one had date time file - and dark theme.,
Color Scheme,Very good app but crashes when on dark theme,
Color Scheme,Minimalistic approach to whatever the purpose it serve is very much appreciated. Black theme and open source code are bonus.,
Color Scheme,the app seems sufficient. Please add a dark theme. thank you.,
Color Scheme, Extremely helpful for remembering school assignments especially as a notification  shortcut. I would love to see a pitch black theme to complement my phone.,
Color Scheme, An AMOLED dark mode (real black)  would be nice - though.,
Color Scheme, But can the dark theme be also actually in notifications bar not just the app when setting up,
Color Scheme,I have it set for dark theme and nothing has changed. It needs more options - like a pop up on screen and mayb ability to change color of the check mark in the system tray?,
Color Scheme,Great app..can you please add automatic switching between light and dark themes?,
Color Scheme, I have a material dark theme - and the font is black too.,
Color Scheme,Love this app a lot! Can we have a dark theme? Does exactly what I need it too. Simple and clean!,
Color Scheme,Can we have black theme for this app?,
Color Scheme,Simple and Great. Thank you for the Dark Theme,
Color Scheme, I wish there were options to make the color scheme less terrible - I really don't like the background color. Also - I feel like collapsing a post should hide that posts text as well as its children. Finally - no way to copy text in a comment. Otherwise - good job!,
Color Scheme,How do you tell what you've upvoted? Would like a dark theme.,
Color Scheme, I prefer this one over the Google messaging app - more color options - plus night mode and delayed messages are great,
Color Scheme,So much customization. Love the colour theme so much,
Color Scheme, The app looks nice and performs well - and I really enjoy the interface customization. However - I have had issue with getting the notification LED color to be green - and not red on my particular device. I'm also consistently not notified of new Group or MMS messages. Overall - it's been a nice alternative to hangouts - and I'll be using it for the foreseeable future. Hope to see continued development and improvement.,
Color Scheme,Great dark and black themes. Well done!,
Color Scheme, It is an amazing alternative to the default texting app - and I love the dark theme.,
Color Scheme, It keeps crashing and force closing on my G3. Dark theme doesn't work properly either. Back to Messenger.,
Color Scheme, Very nice app. I would love to see individual contact conversation color and it's customization. Thanks.,
Color Scheme, The dark gray and black themes cause the suggested contacts to be unreadable when composing a new message. Otherwise good.,
Color Scheme, Black mode doesn't work on the droid turbo. When I set it to black mode in a few hours it reverts back to off-white.,
Color Scheme, Been using Handcent for a long time. I love all of its customizations but want a material design. Would like this more if it had the same type of individual customizations like Handcent. Different color schemes - sounds - different bubble types for each contact texts to name a few. Make it more customizable and I will change the stars.,
Color Scheme, Needs option to set background color too. Not ready yet,
Color Scheme, I love this app. My messages customized to black theme.,
Color Scheme,What happened? Recently - NewsBlur has either displayed articles in black on black - or it displays articles with messed up pagination and overlapping text. The website doesn't have this problem.,
Color Scheme, At least give us a black theme and mark as read when you scroll past a post.,
Color Scheme,Works great and fast. Please add dark theme.,
Color Scheme,Five star app once there's a dark theme.,
Color Scheme,Dark Theme master race,
Color Scheme, New material design is brilliant. Dark theme is a BIG PLUS on amoled screen devices.,
Color Scheme,Intuitive and beautiful app - would recommend the dark theme,
Color Scheme, Just the job. I'll please provide a dark theme.,
Color Scheme,please add function to adj brightness - saturation -contrast -shap,
Color Scheme,Excellent app... Just found your all app and just like every app..For It is open-source (written don't know personally ) and second most Important is Black theme in your every app...just wow...so 5 star from me.,
Color Scheme,I love this problem but only one issue i found it on working is the user unable to change the app theme and unable to change the default black theme,
Color Scheme, App was great until the white theme seared my eyeballs out.,
Color Scheme, Is it possible to have a night mode?  The glare from all the white background is blinding during bedtime,
Color Scheme, Can you option to inverted color? (black instead of white) going to have to uninstall. Sorry.,
Color Scheme, The clue boxes are MASSIVE.  I loved when it had dark theme available.  I have horrible eyes - and the white gives me migraines.  Fix please?,
Color Scheme, I like the new look. Change is refreshing. Always appreciated that the developer doesn't ignore this app. Hoping for a dark theme. Downgrading my rating because the word direction randomly changes which is incredibly annoying.,
Color Scheme,Really simple to use and love the standard dark theme. Donation sent! Thank you.,
Color Scheme, Works excellent and lightweight.  Should have had the dark theme option though.,
Color Scheme, Add a black theme if you can.,
Color Scheme,please add disconnect widget -and dark theme,
Color Scheme,This app is fantastic. It has a dark theme and plays nice with Chromecast. The fact that it is open source and ad-free is just icing on the cake.,
Color Scheme,Dark theme podcaster that just works!,
Color Scheme,Love the app - simple - search within itunes or others - schedules downloads - dark theme. Hugely customizable. Thank you.,
Color Scheme,Simple yet powerful interface - would like a dark theme option,
Color Scheme,please add pure black theme. It would be great at night.,
Color Scheme,thank you for your app - its nice but I should like to see black theme.,
Color Scheme,Please add dark mode.,
Color Scheme,Love the dark theme!,
Color Scheme, New update is good could be even better with a white theme,
Color Scheme,Wonderful clean UI - snappy - works well - lovely dark theme.,
Color Scheme,Only issue is I wish it had an AMOLED black theme,
Color Scheme,Needs a dark theme option,
Color Scheme,Y U NO add dark theme,
Color Scheme,Needs a dark theme - otherwise a nice app.,
Color Scheme,App keeps improving. Missing dark theme unfortunately.,
Color Scheme,Great app but needs theme support or at least a dark theme,
Color Scheme,Works! Please add a pitch black theme to the app.,
Color Scheme, The dark theme is a must on samsung devices.,
Color Scheme,Please add Amoled black theme. Thank you for app.,
Color Scheme, Light and simple app for FB - much better than the original. One thing... When you use the dark theme - is still goes white when refreshing - and turns dark when it's done. Can this be changed so it's always dark?,
Color Scheme,Dark theme have a little bug in the font color..,
Color Scheme,Dark Theme ... fb could learn a thing or two from this app.,
Color Scheme, Simple clean fast! And - the dark theme is great for night use.,
Color Scheme,Please add dark theme,
Color Scheme, Dark theme - please!,
Color Scheme,Nice.. A dark theme could be there - though...,
Color Scheme,Very basic -- a positive quality for this sort of utility. For style - I'd only want basic transition effects (ie fade) and background colors.,
Color Scheme, This app looks and feels great. I LOVE the AMOLED black mode - this is an increasingly desirable feature for me and Slide's implementation doesn't leave anything out. I also really like the ability to customize the header and status bar colors - and even navigation colors which is really seldom used in apps so it's refreshing to finally see an app that lets you use that if you want it. Overall just the best Reddit app - makes me excited to open Reddit again!,
Color Scheme," Tried it - loved it and bought it! Has a great ""feel"" to it and looks gorgeous with the AMOLED black theme.",
Color Scheme, Fantastic app - light theme looks fantastic,
Color Scheme, Best app for Reddit on Android - and I have tried them all. Has the best - coolest user interface. Change the color scheme to  any color you want. The developer is obviously very talented - and obviously spent a lot of time developing it - and for it to be ad free - is a very selfless and nice thing to do - and all he asks for is a good rating. So show him your appreciation by rating 5 stars - and maybe donate a few bucks. Thanks brother!,
Color Scheme, It does not have a dark black theme. It's grey theme.,
Color Scheme,No ads. works well. there is black theme for you. thank you developer.,
Color Scheme, The white bright theme consumes battery and doesn't look good at night. Please bring a black theme also,
Color Scheme,Dark theme's missing.,
Color Scheme, Hi there - I tried to use your app on an S6 when I really need an app like this for a small home project but yours was hardly usable due to colors. You shoud make that buble white - or other color - so it should be contrasted with that blunt gray backgound. Because the buble has no evident color I eas strugling to see how acurate is its position. One star - because I couldn't use your app when I need it for the purpose it was built.,
Color Scheme,Excellent! Please add white theme. Also please add source - for example Top Stories - New York Times. Also please fix ' for quotes in some titles (Daily Wire for example).,
Color Scheme,Simple and fast. Autosaving is a life saver. Exactly what I wanted. Dark theme is a nice bonus!,
Color Scheme,Great - simple app that lets you have text documents with unlimited characters (as far as I'm aware) which is what was limiting about the pre-installed text editor that came on my phone. It also has a dark theme which is a big plus for me.,
Color Scheme,NEEDS BLACK (& White) THEME TOO (like B&W editor mode) dark theme is too light. 5* Fantastic - thanks for adding dark mode as requested. Thanks also for adding smaller font sizes. Please give us (1) BLACK MODE (black background) too. + (2) Double click on text in preview mode: enters edit mode (option in settings) + (3) Hiding top panel when swiping down would be good - optimum screen acreage use on phones. This is an amazing app.,
Color Scheme, Best app! The Dark theme missing after update. I use it every day - hope to see this option in next version. Thanks.,
Color Scheme, I currently can't use this yet - without a dark theme. Hopefully you'll add that choice in a future version.,
Color Scheme, After update can not get night mode to work properly. Just black on black. No effect after changing settings.,
Color Scheme,Amazing app with black theme,
Color Scheme,Excellent - simple checker with schedule reminder - progress views for each habit - color coding - and night mode (dark) interface. I have tried 6 habit building apps so far and this one is the best - doing only what it needs to and not being a distraction. I also like that it is easy to follow up on past days that I did not have my phone with me. I recommend you give this one a test drive if you are looking for a habit tracking or everyday reminder app.,
Color Scheme,Absolutely wonderful app - with minimal permissions asked - good interface and very practical. Also cool dark theme - +1 !!!  I would rate this 5/5 if there was an option to transfer to the SD card for saving-space issues on the device. Please fix this - very important for us busy people Ã°ÂŸÂ˜ÂŠ thank you so much,
Color Scheme,Perfect OLED Night Mode!,
Color Scheme,This is one of the cleanest and most stunning apps I've ever used. It can be simple or complex according to your needs! Absolutely worth a try. I use dark mode and bright colours to separate habit categories (ie Routine -health -home) Thankyou to the app developer and creator its phenomenal.,
Color Scheme,Simple easy to use - and just what i need gets right to the point.  Plus a dark theme love it.,
Color Scheme,I love the App but do well to add a mild background colour.,
Color Scheme,Please add a dark theme. Cheers!,
Color Scheme, BUT. Remove Tor Support and please add a full AMOLED Black Theme Mode,
Color Scheme, I perhaps consider adding a holo light theme?  The only issue I have seen so far is the theme snapping to red for an instant before page loads. Overall - very complete for a first built. Good job!,
Color Scheme, Great but I would like to be able to choose my color. The red is hard to see.,
Content, Great browser nice and fast. Please add force enabled  zoom. Thanks and keep up the great work.,
Content,For me this is the best browser hands down! It is faster then any other browser out there including chrome and firefox. Lots of customization options...Keep up the great work!,
Content, And I can't reach you via e-mail because your dev e-mail is wrong. And because of that you lost 2 stars.,
Content, Never crashes - easy to use - and a good amount of customization available.,
Content,Finally app I need - definitely not perfect but great. Looking forward to ,
Content,Has folder view - UI customization - equalizer. Does not hide features behind a pay wall. It's an open source project.  A perfect example of a project to be supported by both recommending it and helping however we can to developer.  Thank you for making this player - friend. You're awesome.,
Content, You should add a display timeout option that would really be helpful,
Content," There should be a ""small buttons"" option which would allow to put more buttons on the same page. All buttons of a scientific calculator should fit in one page.",
Content,i started the timer - began working - and not three minutes later i happened to glance at it and it had reset itself to 25 minutes. it has a lovely ui and good customization options - but if it doesn't fulfill its literal only purpose - what's the point?,
Content, It's amazing to have access to all these models which I could never justify purchasing physically at my fingertips for Ã‚Â£2 and always in my pocket on my phone. V200 with 92 skin makes control with small buttons no problem on my Note 4. Thanks to the dev for this. As a mech engineer it's a great tool for design work.,
Content,The app is great for sure bcoz it cares for your privacy but here are some ,
Content,I'm having the following troubles: Sometimes freezes and have to close it. ,
Content, Warning to anyone with epilepsy or neurological conditions - may not have desired effect! Don't have epilepsy but do have RSD and now in a lot more pain.,
Content, I tried the lucid dreaming one for the first time and in the first 5 minutes it gave me a headache. Any suggestions? Thanks,
Content, All it did was give me a HORRIBLE headache and a bit of a sick stomach - but I don't want to put it down as bad because it might work for some people. I think it is all a bunch of nonsense and works kinda like a sugar pill. It is interesting how that makes the warble though.,
Content, What are you trying to do give  someone who has epilepsy a seizure I almost did thanks a lot idiots,
Content, Gives series migraines and does not help.,
Content, If you have a history  of  epilepsy  stay out of creativity,
Content," This app works well - especially ""lucid dream"" - i still remember my dream last week. Amazing!  But i dont like the side effects - like headache and other emotional thing.",
Content, This has got to be a sick joke. Turned on several just for a few seconds..... now I have a migraine!!!!! Seriously I gotta run to take some migraine pills -  now! they keep deleting my review. So this is all fixed and I'm sure any good comments are probably fake!!! Lol,
Content, Followed the instructions. Did several off the programmes - but none worked for me. I actually got a bad headache from the pain relief one,
Content,Caused pain in my head. I do have seizures issues - no mess and seizure free gotten years BUT still feel it affected me badly. Warning seizure people,
Content, He sounds take some getting used to. But I do believe it works. This is a really good free app. B careful if you have epilepsy or sensitive to strobe,
Content, Put the lucid dream one on and couldn't sleep at all. All it does is make me feel relaxed. Also - it's really uncomfortable sleeping with earphones on. The morphine gave me a headache even worse! Anyways - gonna try it some more - just in case it works on me... Might increase the stars then.,
Content,Extremely annoying . Gave me a headache . Uninstalled.,
Content," To the guy who said that the ""lsd gave my friend seizures"" the drug lsd gives you seizures - its one of the major club drugs - so using that  beat should be used with caution or not be used at all",
Content,I think im doing it wrong. I now have a headache. =(,
Content,Its gave me a headache. I don't know if it worked but I'm uninstalling this app.,
Content,I like the app but I can't change the metadata.,
Content, Keeps crashing and text size keeps getting smaller.,
Content, I love this app. It's beautiful - works well - and packs enough customization to make it feel unique. However it has a horrible lag issue. I can't do anything on it without it takes 3-5 seconds to figure out what I want. I'll gladly re-download once this issue is fixed.,
Content,It was so much better before the recent update. Why mess with damn near ,
Content,Good app - except needs much more personalization & options. Hopefully soon - that will come!,
Content, I love this application - the customization is great... However - when I use it my data will not turn off. I don't know if it's a MMS issue through this application - but I can't use it because it's using my data no stop. Please fix!,
Content,Great app and great developer - stays very very active on here and github. ,
Content, It's pretty and I like the customization but still missing necessary features I would need to be my daily driver. I hope they keep on developing.,
Content, This is probably my favorite texting app I've found thus far - but there's one thing that I can't stand about it. When my signal is too low it instantly tells me the message failed to send and it won't even try to send it. I've never had this issue in any other app and it happens to me constantly with this one. I would like it if it at least tried to send it or waited a little bit until the signal improves instead of giving up instantly. Also some more options for customization would be nice.,
Content, I've had one bug - and the active devs make me very confident that it'll be fixed,
Content, Does not always accept my password and even the password retrieval system does not work errors pop up.. Needs a zoom option! Also app fails to DL anymore images after 50.,
Content,I've been a user of NewsBlur ever since Google killed Google Reader - and have been mostly happy...until now. Several weeks ago - rendering in the app was broken - and now it's only usable in dark mode. The developer does not seem to have a fix in sight - so for now I cannot recommend it to new users. As a paid subscriber - I expect more - and am extremely disappointed. Am actively seeking alternatives at this point.,
Content,It's very good - just needs a few more features and improvements. 1. Need ,
Content,Totally killer! Great app - cheap in app purchase - lots of customization - only one thing is missing. Android wear companion app! Being able to quickly add transactions with a wear device can be a a great addition.  Thanks for this amazing piece of software,
Content,The App is nice! But I noticed one thing once - as soon as I upload more pictures - the app is crashing after some time. Ah and a dark mode would be pretty awesome!,
Content,Fantastic!!! Also love the dark theme... The only thing I would recommend is maybe a favourites or even been able to long press and re-arrange the order.,
Content,good... but hangs when zoom in and out picture,
Content,Though there have still been problems with zooming - overall - it's the best app if its type that I've used.,
Content,Great app! Few bugs and well maintained! Thank you for bringing gif zooming back! People - this is a quality developer - this app if well worth the money.,
Content,overall very good. But please give zoom & Share option for RAW images... hope you will give this feature update... thank you...,
Content,I really like everything about this app - but I can't zoom in on pictures. Basic function missing.,
Content,I found out something that is a bit uncomfortable sometimes. The problem is: when I zoom in a picture - there is some kind of delay if you want to zoom in again - so if I zoom in - and instantly zoom in again - it just doesn't do anything - you have to wait like half a second before you can zoom in again. But besides that this app is amazing.,
Content,Just the best gallery! At least because this is almost only gallery - that uses multithreading to decode photos - so it works 6-8 times faster then AOSP gallery and other galleries. But I appeal to develoers - please - bring back the zoom - that keeps after changing the photos! I really liked it so much!,
Content,Been using this since earliest versions... no glitz - it does the job well. Latest version sometimes hangs - & it no longer zooms gif images - which I hope is fixed soon. Otherwise - recommended.,
Content,Nice gallery but I cant zoom in on GIFs.,
Content,Great app - simple - complete - but - there's a bug when making zoom in a picture it's locking,
Content,"Just purchased the pro version and found the zoom function not working - it let you zoom in a bit but it just kind of a ""faked"" zoom - a low quality magnification. Cant zoom to actual image size. My bad for not throughly testing the free version before buying the ""pro"" version.",
Content,It was decent - low storage space like I needed. But I could not turn up or ,
Content,I've tried about 4 of these so far. This is the best. I'm a novice. ,
Content, Best crossword app - but doesn't work on Samsung s6. Freezes and I can't tap to a new location. Pls fix - otherwise this is a great game.,
Content,Latest update makes it crrash as soon as it launches. Please fix it soon. The night mode has helped me to fall asleep - which I normally have trouble with. I really do need this app!,
Content, Used to be tolerable despite constant issues with zooming out unexpectedly - now out has decided there is insufficient storage space on my USB drive (which has 2GB free.) Here's hoping I find a better crossword app  :-(,
Content, Only problem is that there are now zoom issues. I can deal with then for the most part - except for the fact that the clues no longer display on screen. Perhaps its because I updated my phone to ics (htc mt4gs) - though.,
Content, Greatly enjoy the easy access to many public puzzles!  The only things I don't like are minor glitches...the annoying accidental zooms - the occasional puzzle that has something other than a single letter in some boxes and doesn't recognize when it's complete - and inability to turn off error counting.   I'm not competing against anyone - so why do I need for all the mistypes from my phone's tiny keys to be thrown back at me?  Take a bit of the fun out.,
Content, The last update screwed with the zoom and now it won't. The now small view makes it very hard to play. Fix it and it will be worth a much higher rating - UPDATE it is fixed Thanks,
Content, Too bad about the zoom problem.,
Content,Great overall - just wish there was an option to disable pinch-zooming and/or lock the existing zoom configuration. It's currently far too easy to accidentally zoom. Still - a great app.,
Content, This is a great app - and is perfect for doing crosswords on the go. There are some zoom issues occasionally - but they've been significantly reduced after the most recent update. The addition of achievements has added another element to the puzzles which I like.,
Content,"The latest update (01 Sept 2015) no longer allows zooming out to fit the entire puzzle width on the screen of my smartphone device. Even the 'zoom to fit screen"" function does not work to properly fit the puzzle to the screen.",
Content, zoom is very fickle - on screen rotations it loses zoom and the resume option is too zoomed in. sometimes freezes when zooming. previous versions were fine. don't fix what isn't broken.,
Content, It has some very serious zoom in issues that I'm sure the most inept intern could reprogram.  Double tap zoom is broken and if the program is left for whatever reason.. it comes back way to small to use.  Galaxy s3.,
Content, OK - I really like this app. I'd pay for it - if the zoom issues ever got fixed (this update actually made them worse - now the zoom is even glitched viewing individual clues and words). I still enjoy the app - I'm just a bit frustrated by the inability to even manually zoom out while fit to screen is broken. Ah well. Hopefully later updates will help.,
Content, Loved this game - now difficult to play due to zooming out on its own - setting changes don't fix it.,
Content, Same issue as previous comment: problems with zoom feature.,
Content, It was great until they updated it and ruined it with the zooming issue. Please fix it!,
Content, Still freezes every few seconds. Still can't zoom to show whole puzzle. Clue boxes still massive.  Thank god for titanium backup. Back to 4.0.7 :-(,
Content,It doesn't zoom anymore.  Please fix - then I'll give 5 stars,
Content, I've had this app for years on other phones but I am also having the zooming problem and it has made it almost unplayable. Going to have look elsewhere.,
Content, What's more - it's fun.,
Content, Zoom functions quit working on droid 1. Got stuck on too-large zoom and it won't zoom back out. Really hosed.,
Content,Perfect! No problems - zooms in and out and very clean looking.,
Content, The most recent update completely killed it with the zooming issues.  I'm not giving up hope - just hoping for the next update to fix it.  As it sits now it's currently unplayable with this issue.  Prior to this update it was hands down the best crossword app on the market.  One star since the last update - but before that a easy 5.,
Content, This was one of my favorite apps but the zoom has completely ruined it! Please fix it!,
Content, Best one out there. The zoom can be an issue sometimes.,
Content, Loved the app until the last update.  The zooming issues are killing me!,
Content, This app worked well and i loved it. Made the mistake of updating it and now it doesnt work good anymore. Keeps zooming out for no reason and wont zoom back in. Very frustrating. Had to uninstall. Very bummed,
Content, I'm still on the fence with the new look but I'm not having the crashes and stability issues others have mentioned. I'm still annoyed that on tablets zoom still maxes out at a puzzle size that is MUCH smaller than the usable area. My rating went from 5 stars to 2 back in Jan 2013 when this issue first became an issue. Almost 2 years later my tablets keep getting bigger which makes my puzzles seem smaller and smaller.,
Content, Good but the game auto rooms out constantly. Tried changing various settings but to mo avail. This became frustrating to the point that I uninstalled.,
Content,Good effort but a bit buggy - especially in zooming/panning. No UK-sourced crosswords - yet... HTC Desire S.,
Content, Awesome - and except no zoom when my galaxy s3 is held sideways,
Content, One suggestion. After password timeout force close application. otherwise a glimpse of contents can be seen.,
Content,This is a great app. Does exactly what I want with no fuss. Only slight problem is that I have to manually shut down the app each time. Otherwise it stays unlocked. Maybe a 5 minutes timeout would be useful to help those who are more forgetful,
Content,Works great! A lot of small things like the app not buffering the codes ,
Content, No ads. Adjustable playback speed while streaming. Excellent access to podcasts from the app.,
Content,Liked it better before the update (even though I'm still very thankful for ,
Content,Really great app and I use it regularly for books and audio lecture series. ,
Content,having problems here need assistance,
Content, I have rated 1 star but happy to change to 5 stars if I can get some assistance as my sent payments just say transaction unconfirmed. I see you keep stating the system is very busy but my incoming payments have all cleared within 1 hour I need to know when normal sent payments are likely to start being confirmed please? Not a small amount of money so I am concerned please answer this query. Thankyou,
Content,good app - zoom is missing,
Content, BTW - thank you for the open sources.,
Content,there are some bug and error when you play the game like there's something to report  (uncaught exemption - nosuchmethod error)after that the game finished geting a low score.. pls fix... and also  the game crashed too... also there are some maps are super hard to play with like random overlaping slides and small buttons.. you dont know what map are good for you if your a beginner since there is no method of adjusting the speed of timing to press and limiting the buttons to press at..,
Content, The app definitely makes browsing HN easier. Story saving option is great. Some small issues: No zoom in while browsing the article websites. Scroll button shows the website as very long even though it isn't. Screen rotation reloads the whole website.,
Content,Cannot zoom in,
Content,Cant zoom in on articles,
Content, Casual browsing is OK. It's missing the option to downvote - flag - or vouch though. Also the top of the article is not available after zooming the view.,
Content,Terrible - I mean TERRIBLE functionality - zooming is a major pain in the ,
Content, Love the look and feel of the app. The customizations are great! Only thing I've noticed is when I unsub from a subreddit - it will not actually unsubscribe me the first time. I then have to go back and reselect unsubscribe - then the app crashes without fail.,
Content,Hi. Thanks for your response - but when I am installing a module - it takes English in the default language. How can I change it?,
Content, the block mode is what i'm looking for.... but how to get the right time??? the displayed time is incorrect - i already set the time zone on google cal... zoom function would be nice,
Content,Increasing block size should also increase font and height of the block. Changes only the width at the moment. And what about pinch to zoom?,
Content, Buggy page turning - no pinch zooming. However - what is making me start looking for other is that it was reading the contents in the wrong order for this last book.,
Content,Can't zoom,
Content,Good but needs a option of zoom,
Content, I cant zoom or the feature hasnt been added.,
Content, On LG G2,
Content, Some comic panels require zooming in. Kindly add that feature.,
Content,it doesnot zoom,
Content, Like it because of its simplicity but you've got to make an easier way to zoom,
Content, Shows comics ok but EXTREAMLY basic!!!!,
Content, Was not able to zoom in on a frame,
Content, No zoom.,
Content, Love it. Maybe some scaling or tiling options would make it even better?,
Content, Excellent customization options - and a lot of great free plug-ins to use for a wide variety of backgrounds. Easily a must-have,
Content,Glitchy - doesn't refresh properly - has too many cluttered or ugly backgrounds and not enough customization.  Waste of time and way overrated.  This is a glorified slideshow that gets stuck constantly.  Maybe it's just my device - but this was a huge disappointment.  S7 running Nougat.,
Content, Runs perfectly. Tons of customizations.,
Content, Looks and feels great. Would be awesome to be able to put it onto the android lockscreen (touchwiz on 4.4) and also be able to choose the amount of zoom on the images. :) great stuff!,
Content, Wow - this wallpaper looks great! You can use the default paintings the app provides - third party add-ons - or your own picture gallery. The blur and brightness settings are fully adjustable. And it's free. Sweet!,
Content, the app -ui everything looks great -but this app is to make homescreen look good -so filling the screen with some useless part of pic isn't good.Either the app should figure this is out itself or an option to manually adjust the wallpaper (zoom out n pan)  must be included.,
Content, How can I export the saved data (favorites - routes - and poi which i saved) from the free version. Thx             EDIT: I am very dissapointed. The free version that I have(2.2.4) seems better than this new one I bought. Whenever i search for a place Adresses - the buttons from the bottom are missing in the new vers...also - after selecting adress and pointing it - the map is really zoomed-out and i see the whole country/europe - opposite from the other vers. where it zooms in onto town/street. Fix it please,
Content, Great improvement. Really like full configuration of text size - zoom level detail - etc. Full version is worth it. Also support is great. Thankyou.,
Content, This is my number one app for motorcycling through the mountains. It gets better with every revision. I recommend it to everyone. the free OSM maps are good and getting better every day. The only reason that I don't give it a 5 is because every time I press the GPS button - it screws up my zoom level. Even with the auto zoom settings off - it screws up my zoom level. So one annoying 'feature'. Please fix. BTW - a weather radar layer would be awesome...,
Content, Worth every penny. Would like to see highway names and numbers at most zoom levels.,
Content,There's no point in rating the app down because your region isn't mapped very well.   The OpenStreetMap project isn't an owned and controlled commercial data-set like - say - Google Maps. It's maintained by the community - its users. By us. If your region's data is inadequate - it's never too late to start contributing yourself!  And regardless of the state of the data - this application is only the front-end to access said data. Rate the application on its own merits - usability - responsiveness - features - etc. It doesn't help anyone to rate the app down for the data it's displaying - these are related projects - but ultimately disjoint.  As for the app itself. It's actually quite good! Lightweight and very functional. I would like it if the search option was more readily accessible - though!,
Content, I use the tracking feature every day. The new design is a great improvement. There's room for improvement in map display (the flickering is distracting) but the map details and privacy of using OSM are must haves.,
Content,Ideal for us TuneIn refugees who are sick of ads that play before the stream begins & then clog up the screen. *This is pure no-frills audio streaming* It even had the station that I was worried I might need to add manually. Bonus points for the option of a dark theme.,
Content, I have been searching for a great reader for already available books. One with nice animations ans all plethora of options and customizations and this is the best of the best.,
Content, Used to need two different apps to handle .txt files and then everything else. This one does both - and more customization options than you can shake a stick at. Well done!,
Content," It still alters the margins when I switch between day and night modes. Perhaps you could offer a ""sync day/night"" function that retains all settings except for font and background color?",
Content,Cannot zoom in/out in spreadsheets.,
Content,Never opened pptx and docx. No zoom in xlsx.,
Content,useless on android phone...no way to zoom into spreadsheets,
Content,Even though It does not run om my Tablet (lenovo idea a1000f with android 4.1.2) -  this version fulfills my request that the volume button on my phone controls the mpd player volume. So - as stated in previous review - that rounds up to 5-star  -)  Good job - Thnx,
Content,This app is amazing! Just downloaded it but i am already sold. What I like:  1. the lack of ads (or at least I haven't seen any so far) 2. The true black mode - i wish more apps were doing this. 3. Logical GUI - no junk features - no branding. 4. Simple widgets   What I dislike: n/a  What I miss: The ability to view multiple habits in the same charts - and some tools to compare which habits are influencing each other. E.g.: to find allergy   Very nice work,
Content,Fantastic! Easy to use - no annoying ads or signups - and thankyou thrice a day for the AMOLED black option for night mode!,
Content,Tried to keep track of my habits on paper - but I came to the conclusion that it was not effective at all. So I run into this app - which is amazing! Works well - looks pretty and clean and offers the flexibility I need. Also - night mode is a very nice touch. Thank you! :),
Content,I love this app - it's thoughtfully  designed including a night mode - a user friendly dashboard and stats section. They did the simple things right and it's definitely helped me become more consistent in my chosen habits.,
Content,"Simple - clean and does what it should without a bunch of extra graphics or guilt- building ""blogs."" Love having night mode (dark screen) as it's very soothing.",
Content,I'm a night mode guy,
Content, The only thing I would change are a couple of minor things (like articles not fitting screen - no image scaling - etc). But - I still love it. Thank you for kiwix!,
Content,Good but we need update to auto adjust the lines when zoom the page. Please add it in next update,
Content, Top marks and well earned too - very well designed interface - offline wikipedia at my tips - intuitive to use -  preemptive search results as you type - zoomable by gestures - table of contents sidebar...  Without doubt - the most useful app I have.,
Content,You have not fixed the problem which I used to send you ... in right to left language for example persian or arabic when we zoom in the text  - partially off pics hide and do not show completely,
Content, I really nd tis app badly. Been using it for so long. The recent update is causing trouble for my galaxy s2. Keeps on flickering when i scroll down and zooming control is somewhat lost. Entire app has slowed down considerably beyond practical use. Pls help me as i nd tis app badly. At least gv d option of installing d old app as well for us who face problems. Much obliged,
Content,Great information and fantastic idea to make it available offline. You can even change the size of the font in case you're stranded without glasses. One nice Improvement would be to have a magnifier that you could scroll over some of the illustrations to zoom in.,
Content,Wow - just wow! I was amazed at the content and features the app has. Printing and auto day/night mode with search function... This is hands down my favourite app now. It's perfect for what I need. Keep up the awesome work team! Ã°ÂŸÂ‘ÂÃ°ÂŸÂ‘Â I only wish they had metric units in the figures and graphs as well - that would be extremely helpful. Other than that. No other problems,
Content,Helpful tips and very informative! But - could use more spacing - bigger/resizable font - subsections - and maybe some material design. Material design will make it have more nougat like features.  You can reference wikipedia's mobile app or webpage for some inspiration. The content is more spaced out and feels less overwhelming.,
Content,Great dark themed version of the original.,
Content,Not responding when using voice command,
Content, What is missing are a few more small buttons on top - for example to annotate with +/-/= etc before saving - and a separate time config for computer vs computer games. Maybe also some skin options - at least black on white for annotations. But that's all minor.,
Content,Excellent. The only thing it lacks is material design black theme,
Content,Horizontal height setting inop. Rises to cover text field. Vertical spacing ,
Content,Auto completion rarely shows any suggestions. Black alternative characters ,
Content, Very good - my only complaints is that it doesn't flow well from thread to thread - and the red icon in night mode being distracting.,
Content,I like the game. I can't see the scores very well,
Content,Pretty good - but missing one key feature. It would be perfect with a night mode/dark theme.,
Content, Nice app and seems to log fine - but please make the charts zoomable as one can not see details and exact hours now. Thank you!,
Content,Very hard to see.,
Content, I had no problems importing all of my Astrid tasks.  This one does almost everything that Astrid Premium did.  It would be nice to have a few more widget options - and to allow some more customization.  I look forward to new features being added.,
Content,Fix white splash screen even in dark theme and add flawless animations from Telegram X.,
Content,the download options for large files lile video must be modified  - we can't see downloading precentage  -we are not able to resume it either... plz improve...,
Content,hey its funny it cannot show subtitles correctly.,
Content,This app is really awesome. Very user friendly compared to mx player. I use this app both in my PC and Mobile. Only feature I need is the mute option. Please make this option available in the next update.,
Content,works great - but cant seek with .ts file - also subtitle does not work when casting stream video,
Content,It's Wikipedia! What's not to love? :) I love reading Wikipedia and the app ,
Content, Thank you so much for this app and the new dark theme. I use this app every single day - and I love it. Thank you for putting a world of information at my fingertips - I simply can't say enough good things about it :) :) :),
Content,Dark mode is now fixed. Thanks for accepting the feedback :),
Content,great App to cure your curiousity or to begin learning something new. dark mode is great for the eyes,
Content,Free and easy to use. It would be better if the dark and black theme doesn't interfere with the colours found in tables,
Content,I liked how it used to show the content collapsed to each heading. Bring that feature back please,
Content, Won't save video in a recognizable format to play on Android system and it zooms in during editing making it impossible to edit the videos,
Content,cannot change language from french to english,
Content,Doesn't bug me about local offers or syncing - just stores my cards. I'd give it 5 stars if it let me set a background colour for each card to identify them at a glance.,
Content,Great app - though i have some suggestions. Add an option to add the file explorer option in the main gallery. Also double tap to zoom isn't working properly. otherwise great app. Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â,
Content,It's ok but the editing icons come up in white over the image.. which obvioulsy means if you have a white image you cannot see them Ã°ÂŸÂ¤Â¦Ã¢Â€ÂÃ¢Â™Â‚Ã¯Â¸Â Seriously - how could a developer get something so obvious that wrong? Just put them in a panel across the bottom.,
Content,too barebone - no way to set font size and no repeated reminders,
Content,Very good but missing volume control...,
Content, Just wish you could fast foward via Bluetooth... I don't need trackers and such....definitely don't need my music player to be online! Thanks for bringing back the dark theme also!,
Content, Sorry - but version 1.9 was excellent. Update to 2.0 and 2.1 broke it since now sometimes the alarm is muted. Not good for something that is supposed to wake you up. The alarm volume seems to be tied media volume and not alarms. Since most of the time my media volume is very low and at night I use do not disturb - the alarm does not sound. This seems like it should not be very difficult to fix. I will reinstall when this is fixed. I also don't prefer the long press to edit -  it was better before.,
Content,Cannot set volume on my htc desire. Don't want to wake to max volume - so uninstalling,
Content, Love the app! And have been using it for years and years! However - with the new update - I'm experiencing that my alarms are soundless when my phone are on mute - which it is pretty much all the time - Which again makes it a little bit useless for me right now at the moment but hopefully there will be a fix,
Content,Stop autoplay videos,
Content,Please add ability to change volume of tones within apps - as I like to use this in combination with music and sleep hypnotherapy sometimes the sound of the tones can be loud and unpleasant during YouTube videos!!!! will give 5 stars for added feature.,
Content,the very very very good browser great on privacy the only complaint I have is that like most browsers that allows those annoying ads to autoplay I would give you five stars if you would put a function in there that would prevent videos from auto-playing unless you specifically turned it on,
Content,THE AMOUNT OF FAKES AND TROLLS IS RIDICULOUS PLEASE I AM BEGGING YOU ADD A MUTE FEATURE FOR THE CHAT PLEASE!!! Edit: Yes,
Content,I really enjoyed this app when I first downloaded and found it very useful for sleeping on long flights - falling asleep in hotels - drowning out background noise in our open concept office - & dealing with panic attacks. But today - it started autoplaying everytime I hung up from a call - and since I use my mobile all day for work - you can imagine how irritating!!! If this bug were fixed - I would reinstall it.,
Content,I tried the sleep introduction. Gave me a headache and the volume was  low made my joints hurt. And stomach upset and I can't sleep in headphones.,
Content,Is lacking customization option....  I wana set my own frequency or make a whole program that I make for what I want or need!  So I'm moving to a similar app that comes with this capability~,
Content,Great app - update option to change volume on background noise is fantastic. Would love if could set own frequencies. Hope to see more presets :-),
Content,Now it looks as great as it works - great job. The flipping mute/unmute animation was a nice touch.,
Content, I like the app but other people on the server complain that my voice is too loud. I need the ability to reduce outgoing volume.,
Content, It's starting to feel pretty snappy - and the text size enhancement is great. A few small additions like better video embedding - long-press options on links - and image alt text would push this to a 5 star app.,
Content,A very good music player but I can't set the volume to the max -maybe because my device is already 5-year old.. but with my other player i can set it to the max.. I don't know why..,
Content,Would be nice to be able to change language. And please make Turku edition.,
Content,It's very good just that you can't use subtitles for movies which you download but overall it's awesome,
Content,I would honestly rate it 5 - but gave it 2 to bring attention to missing features. Paid for pro app mainly to support Dev. :) My crituqes on the video player: -No slow/fast play rate- (0.13x) would be great. -No color adjustments (saturation/contrast etc.) -No zoom-in video feature. I would definitely re-rate to 5 if these features are implemented! I love your work,
Content," No mention that the voice costs extra until you want to use it. And ten-second maximum duration for voice recordings? What - you think people want encrypted voice communications just to say - ""Oh - and extra pepperoni with that""? Come on. And why would someone want the voiceclip to play automatically when it arrives? Geez. Tried to get a refund after the 6 minutes it took me to find this all out after installing and paying - but no such option.",
Content,Solid app - but occasionally the podcasts start playing layered over each other - often multiple copies of the same podcast at different points. Pausing the podcast won't stop the overlapping sounds and only closing the app will stop it - but it will start happening whenever I reopen the app,
Content,This app is perfect. No adware. Also being able to add any podcast using an ,
Content,Lots of customization options - lets you pause and resume - download - subscribe etc across multiple devices if you sync via gpodder - and no ads! Love the app - but it has a few bugs - which are occasionally annoying - but don't tend to cause many problems.,
Content,It's ok. It works well most of the time. I love the dark theme option! But there is a major issue with playback. It - all too regularly - will skip the end of an episode. Sometimes it seems like just seconds (which is bad enough) - but it can be several minutes. I just had it skip almost 8 minutes of a 39 minute episode! That's 20%!! And the worst part is - it shows it as if it played to the end. So you have to search to figure out where it left off. That is especially frustrating when you are in the middle of something - and you have to stop and go back to find the episode - just so you don't miss the end of it.  It's been a while since I used this app regularly - but I may switch to a different podcast app if this keeps up!,
Content,No ads.free FOSS. For podcast enthusiast by podcast enthusiast prpgrammer. Adjustable speed. Choose player. Import opml.search podcast directly from app. What you want more? Flattr the guy ASAP,
Content, Works well - nice job! But it'd be even more useful with a pause button. It slowly registers steps while I drive - and I'd like to be able to stop that.,
Content," After the ""mute"" fix all seems fine. Thanks. Great app - appreciated very much",
Content, Boom! Doesn't consume too much memory - this the bomb. Only one more thing - why there's no Autoplay in the videos?  But other than that - 5 stars!,
Content,it is simple. pls add below features ability to remove minus button. tap sound volume level can be adjusted and make plus button bigger,
Content, still room for improvement - but gets all the basics nailed down. so much flexibility with the sword platform.. i love being able to get commentaries as well as different Bibles! text-to-speech is another advantage over youversion Bible - which eats up data downloading audio. i look forward to seeing more great stuff from this app!,
Content,Would  be nice to have numerical representation of  bands and a little bit lower low range. Also - this is just a fantasy - would be awesome to be able to zoom into bands.,
Content, If you want noise for sleeping - this is the app to get. Change the noise so it's exactly what you want. It has a stop button in the status bar - it's free - and it has no ads. Only thing it's missing is a donate button!,
Content,Cool app - but there's no way to quit it and it takes over my volume buttons for media volume the whole time it's open. Needs a quit option.,
Content, As promised - fifth star is given now that you have added subtitles/audio options in the internal player.,
Content, I am using it for months. Box is now far away from the reach of children! Please please bring back previous logo - was really distinguishable,
Content,Some features like blur background - contrast - noise reduction are missing. In comparison to Cinema FV 5 this is not as good as it. Not Bad. It is pretty good.,
Content,Good but we cannot mute the shutter sound,
Content,So much better than the stock camera on my phone. Can control the exposure level that was washing out the colors and making everything way too bright. Other processing options are a bonus. No ads is a plus. Major kudos to the developer.,
Content,I like this app except for one major annoyance. Whenever I open the app it blasts my screen brightness to full - then dims after closing the app. I don't like being blinded,
Content,It's too bright and it can harm your eyes,
Content,In this app when we shoot video ther is no option of pause.plzz add this pause button..,
Content,Nice app - but no pause button for video recorder..,
Content, exactly what im looking for.  a plethora of customization options too!!!  very pleasing.,
Content, Very good! Needs control options for in/out video quality and definitely MUTE MICROPHONE. Other than that perfect.,
Content,Unless you have MAJOR experience with whatever this is... you will never be able to use it. Yeah - download the designer. I am a well above average pc user - the designer might as well be chinese because I have no clue what any of it means. Basically - unless you have extensive home automation experience - don't even bother. This is in no way navigable for a newer and moderate user.,
Content, really like this app - does everything I would like it to except colour-coding. Its difficult to see some of the tasks in the widget due to my wallpaper - which I'm not changing.  Sort that and it's a 5,
Content,Issues with subtitles in chromecast - subs don't play in tv when casted.,)
Content,A nightmare - unable to control volume - deleted app,
Content,the old VLc is so cool ...and its not all in your face with small fonts and small video icons ...i think i need to get a new video player,
Content,The application is very good - you just need to make available the font size of the subtitles.,
Content,"Why don't you put ""load subtitles from file"" option while using chromecast? It would be a great app if it had been done.. But now - users just have to watch movies only in their language on chromecast.",
Content,while casting subtitles not working....,
Content,good - but casting needs volume control,
Content,my only problem is i cannot turn off the subtitles track on my films even though i have selected no subs.. as the sub track got added by accident. the subs dont play on other video apps.,
Content,Thanks for fixing the dark mode bug. App is perfect now. Ã°ÂŸÂ‘Â,
Content,I will give it five stars as soon as problem is fixed because it is a good ,
Content,please add sinhala unicode subtitle rendering. not correctly working.,
Content,The good about this update is it allows a background for subtitles which is fantastic. But now it can't play my dvd ISO files like last time. please fix that and for me - that would be best.,
Content,i had problems with external subtitles downloaded from plugins. on older kodi versions those plugins worked without any problems.,
Content, There needs to be a a way to scrub video and change audio languages/ subtitles from the app. It can be done in Yatse.,
Content,Really awesome frontend to one for multiple KODI servers. Gives access to almost all features of the backend. Nice gimmicks such as volume control via the phone's buttons. BTW - I really don't understand why some people write angry reviews and give only one star - when they only miss a single feature in the app (which is free and OSS!). Respect to the Kore team for responding to such moronic reviews in a polite manner.,
Content, No stop button? What's with that? I have to fast forward to the end. And no widget either. And doesn't always connect to kodi,
Content,What the actual fuxx is up with the RED MUTE BUTTON FROM HELL. THIS APP CRIPPLED MY ANDROID BOX.,
Content,If the network state changes - the app becomes completely inaccessible for an indefinite period of time. It keeps crashing,
Content,I've always been a fleksy user - which is lightweight - but has too much fluff like emojis. Found this minimal keyboard and have been using it. I recommend this keyboard to everyone. To the dev - i dont care about spellcheck and definitely not emojis - but a mic option in the future would make me uninstall other keyboards. Cuz when im driving i always have to re-enable one like fleksy just for the microphone. So please please think about adding one. Along with a black theme. And perhaps an option for when double tapping the spacebar will insert a period? Thanks for your work....,
Content,LOVE IT. Fast - Adblock and has a night mode! Reminds me of the day when I used Firefox until it got sooooo slow!,
Content, I love it! Just needs a night mode and it would be perfect,
Content, Doesn't allow to change background color from white. So you hurt your eyes in the dark environment and drain your phone's battery faster because the screen takes more energy to display white color.,
Content,bad... cannot see left side of the document,
Content,has too small fonts in content,
Content, In honesty - I only downloaded because of the name first - however it's actually a really good app. Enjoy the customization of the widget and the support.,
Content, Material design is good but whitish backgrounds are a sore to my eyes. Edit: thank you!!,
Content, Has some great qualities. Every tower has regular upgrades and evolution upgrades. You get more money when starting waves early which is the main strategy of upgrading - and it stacks. Id like to see more maps and towers - a dictionary of the enemies and towers - and a pause button though. Also - when placing towers - it's hard to see where they are being placed. That needs fixing. And you need a way to cancel building a tower.,
Content,What happened to the themes? My eyes are very light sensitive and I really appreciate dark themes. As is - I can't use the app long enough to really see how good it may be. Too uncomfortable and my eyes keep watering.,
Content,No dark theme - more clicks to get to hex than before - not as nice design as stock Oneplus One calculator.,
Content, Thanks for the lollipop treat.... A request to increase the font size as in the previous version,
Content, Which was my original reason for getting this. The new design is a downgrade both in looks and usability.,
Content, Great app! Quick suggestion - I'm always late night working with this app. To have a night theme would be amazing. Keep up the great work!,
Content,No ads - but has some bugs: In landscape mode 1) I can't see minus buttons - when changing time 2) I change alarm time via hw kb but alarm didnt chang,
Content,Nice - need a night mode now.,
Content, Finally - I found an app that can help me in creating a world for my story. However - please make some adjustments in the font size of the app. It is too big for me. And also make some adjustments of the backgrounds color. It is quite disturbing for me. Thank you.,
Content, Visually clean - not cluttered like some apps I've tried before. One thing I'd like to see is a dark theme - something for nighttime viewing. A good example would be Discord's dark theme.,
Content,Been using this for a while - and I love it - but it's started to get kinda glitchy lately. The autocapitalisation doesn't work - and when I write in a box - it scrolls to the top on its own and I can't see what I'm doing.,
Content,I like the idea of this app - but do not like the font. Please add an option to change font or go to the phone's system font. And I will quickly redownload it.,
Content, Please include various themes specially dark one.,
Content,night mode feature isn't available in this version,
Content,Font size in widget cannot be changed,
Content, The theme is very good - i like it very much. But the timer circle is full black - so i can't see the time of recording... Please fix this error - add more settings,
Content,Great app! The only thing I miss is a dark mode. Too bad the app looks like it's dead,
Content,"It's ok and light but missing mamoled/night mode and few bugs like ""can't ",
Content, Don't be fooled by the seemingly primitive graphics - which conceal amazingly accurate and entertaining gameplay. This one is better than any of the paid pinball apps in terms of sheer entertainment value. Everything runs smoothly and you quickly become immersed in the environment. In some cases - such as this one - simple (graphics) is better. One tip: use the HD option and OpenGL rendering - and turn up the brighness. Otherwise the blue table outlines are too hard to see.,
Content,A bit of a hidden gem. I've only really explored the first table - but there are so many subtleties and techniques to it. I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for dozens of hours of entertainment. Kind of wish it had higher contrast lines and maybe a light mode.,
Content,No night mode,
Content,love the dark theme and overall ui of itÃ°ÂŸÂ˜Â€,
Content,Amazingly fast - ad-free browser with dark UI mode. Please add an option to view/read content in dark mode too. Thanks.,
Content,I like the fact that DuckDuckGo offers a private browser on mobile and so far - the functionality seems good. The only thing that annoys me is that when viewing open tabs - most of the time it isn't possible to tell what they are because only part of the URL is visible - no page title or description or anything helpful. This means I have to open each one individually in order to remember what it was.,
Content,I like this app - I think it does its job well! I just wish there was an easier way to refresh pages - and maybe some additional design features not just dark/night mode? But overall - it's pretty good.,
Content,Please add a black night mode option for AMOLED displays.,
Content,Just downloaded.. so far nice... but sad I'd  have to pay five bucks a year to get dark mode...every dollar counts right  now... so this app  is low in my budget lol.,
Content,Nice app. I use adblocker so it will only kill this app. I have always used the genius app - so kinda used to.  But keep it up.  There are other people who will definitely find this useful. I don't like the font size btw - or maybe change the font to something else like proxima nova -  Oswald -  ..anything. P.S rated 5 star cause..LANA DEL REY!,
Content, Incredibly useful - almost never fails - and simple. Glad to see true dark mode has been implemented. Would be even better with AMOLED-friendly black mode,
Content, I'd love to see a theme with light text on a dark background - possibly independent of the amber/black themes that are currently available. Keep up the amazing work!,
Content,"Some lyrics are not found sometimes and the response time it's to be improved. As well as the ""identify lyrics feature"". Oh - and the night mode should be optional - regardless of the time zone. But it works and it's ok for now.",
Content, Looks good - works fast and the new auto night mode is awesome...  If it retrieves more lyrics - it's near perfect!,
Content, This app was great before recent update! Blows now...too bright - life counter resets to -1 for some stupid reason and the search feature sucks now...yuck! Boomerang!,
Content,Long time user - recommend to all MTG friends on Android!  Small note to the dev: most card images have white corners that stick out against the dark theme background. Is there anything you can do?? I'll give 5 stars if you can fix this very minor issue :),
Content,Great - better than the original - mostly because it includes everything the original has - and then some. My only real gripe is that the icons in the dark theme are dark too. Thats kind of an oversight. Otherwise - good work!,
Content,Thank you for this update and thank you for continuing to work on this game! The new menu animation looks amazing and the dark theme is a nice touch. It seems that open-source developers are mostly the ones who appreciate the importance of dark themes. I have most of the game yet to explore - and I look forward to doing so!,
Content, Very difficult to see your health bar whilenin combat.  This has resulted in my death many times over.  Ugg.  Still gg for free!,
Content, definitely dont use this if you have adhd or really any neurological disorders of any kind - because that puts you at a higher risk of seizures and its really not safe. the warning/disclaimer should probably be displayed upon opening the app - as its not very common for people to go through and read the details.,
Content,BEAUTIFUL! Sleek - gorgeous - easy - just started use it and fell in love with it. PLUS: it has dark mode and doesn't have ads. Hugely recommend it!,
Content,It's great - however when using the dark theme at night and then opening the ,
Content, Material design + Customization is great. I can't find any other player as good as this one.,
Content,Nice design and many customizations! Ã°ÂŸÂ‘Â,
Content, Best crossword app by far and best of all free. Would love to see the experimental puzzles fleshed out further. Love the cryptics but can't see if I've started them or not from the listing screen because they just show in red.,
Content,Exellent! Would be nice to be able to set a night mode ( white numbers on ,
Content, Great app.  Latest update claims there is a night mode - but I can't get it to work.  Would be 5 starts otherwise.,
Content, Night mode is a Good idea. But button difficult to press.,
Content,Night mode is not working for me. My best score is 104620. Anyone has better score?,
Content, Night mode themes would be great. As we are playing in bed at night and the screen just way to bright lmao other than that awesome game,
Content,good idea but is it possible to make it height adjustable? Also didnt see the underscore key - which is a big draw back for me. everything else was pretty great. good app!,
Content,works great - was blind - prev rating stating I could not find how to scan 5G range - on very top - will look over code and see how this may be made more obvious.,
Content,Good app. But one major flaw. When it uploads picture messages I sent to Gmail - it tags the message with my own number - not the name and number of the receiver. This is not the intended behavior. When in Gmail - I can't see who I sent the picture to - it just says my own number and that's it. Only happens with picture messages. Can the dev look into this?,
Content, Easily 5 stars! Anyway we can get a material - light themed update?! I'd pay again!,
Content,Great application but it really needs a dark theme option and is a little buggy on Android Oreo,
Content, Works flawlessly - and provides a lot of customization.,
Content,Fully featured vpn should have dark mode. open vpn connect does. I got a ,
Content,Please provide dark theme - current white hurts eyes,
Content,Nice podcast app that has a lot of customization possible. Use it out of the box and it works well too. Also has a nice dark mode and is content network agnostic.,
Content,Simple - nice looking - and has all the features you'd ever need. Only thing missing is a true AMOLED black theme.,
Content,Solid podcast player with lots of little customization available that you'd appreciate once you use it regularly. Completely free and open source: you can help to customize it you want too.,
Content, I love the customization options that this app has. It does everything I want without asking for a bunch of permissions that it doesn't need.,
Content, It's a good app. Lots of customization possible and it's open source so that's cool.,
Content,Great app.  AD FREE!  A lot of options for customization  Love it!!,
Content,it lets me keep track of all my podcasts and it has tons of customization options (the most useful of which I've found is the auto-dowload/delete setting) plus - I've yet to see an ad. try it! Ã°ÂŸÂ‘Â,
Content, Hands down the best podcast app I've found - though it needs a bit of customization after installation.,
Content,Works as advertised - but missing some notable features. Coming from PlayerFM - I'm missing a number features. There appears to be no way to set - per subscription - the display order. (Such as oldest-&gt -newest) I can't find any option for setting download limits per subscription - for example downloading 5 episodes of one and 1 for the others. There are very few display options. Even the dark theme (the only alternative) isn't black - meaning it's wasting battery on AMOLED screens.,
Content,Easily the best podcast app on android. Clean - simple - powerful - dark theme - works brilliantly and no ads. Ideal.,
Content, My netcast player of choice. Whenever I get a new phone - this is one of the first things I install. Nice - clean interface - love the dark theme. Best of all - open source. Keep it up!,
Content,Better than most of the Android podcast players out there. I've tried 4 or 5 different ones. Antenna pod is a keeper. No ads - lots of customization options. Ability to adjust the speed of play.,
Content, This app combines a very simple text ui with a fairly robust die configuration that should be suitable for almost any tabletop game. All that bundled up in a package that has no ads or permission requests.,
Content, Now this is what I call wallpaper customization. Had a blast making a wallpaper exactly how I like it.,
Content,Works great for the most part. Games are easy to download and input. Don't see as many in-game bugs as other platforms. Help menus are a little buggy and there are no in-game headers but I enjoy this app a lot. Use it all the time.,
Content,Edit: I love the new sleep timer layout!  I've had this app for over a year now and it continues to deliver new features! My favourite audiobook app! The design is simple and easy to use. For such a simple app - I am surprised by how many customizations there are.,
Content,It's amazing. It has only those features that you really need and looks beautiful. No IAPs - no ads. Has a free Dark Theme.,
Content,I was able to confirm the security patch level - however the information could be presented in a nicer way. Also the was some major flickering going on which made it hard to evaluate - still I got the most part out of it - I think.,
Content,Probably the best XKCD app available. Offline download of comics and what-ifs - explain links - and lots of customization options are wonderful.,
Content,Xkcd goodness in a convenient app with dark theme - what more can you ask for?,
Content,Love the night mode!,
Content,great app. awesome selection - fantastic customization - simple yet challenging game... Ad Free!!!! Don't change a thing!!!!,
Content,It looks much better than the screenshots above! Ad free - No bloats - Simple interface - Allows enough customization for all the night owls who prefer a dark background.,
Content,"Simply Superb. Added all pro features. R U kidding me? With full features (really great stuff - for less than a good burger) I am probably paying less than a penny per hundred hours of your talent and devotion. I worked as a LAN admin for a major brokerage house. We paid literally thousands of times more for stuff to debug (I know you know what I am referring to). If you are not a techie - buy full package for dark theme - read the FAQ carefully - and don't mess with the system services - not a bit. The basics will do what you want to protect your privacy and lower traffic and battery use. Don't turn on stuff you don't need. This will run ""light on battery"" if you allow it to. My device is an LG V20 staying with Android 7 Nougat.",
Content,Wow! Very impressive client! Only thing left for me to wish for is a dark theme actually! I'd love to see this app dressed in black! ^^ great work!,
Content,I can't seem to view my score to the online leaderboards - or the Global Leaderboards - it is blank - also - when I play hardrock - circles gets smaller? I dunno if that is included to make the map harder. But if i play with a map with small circles - and plus with hardrock - it is very very hard to see where the circles are. But overall - my problem is my Global Ranking Leaderboards - I can't see people who've played this map - so fix it please,
Content,make the hitcircle adjustable because in some devices - the hitcircle is just too small,
Content, But pls add dark theme for read articles. 2016 Dec 04: awesome update! Thanks for dark theme and two ways sync. I love it - guys.,
Content, I really like the end to end encryption - even if I'm not totally relying on it. Would be nice to have a dark theme for AMOLED screens.,
Content, I like the design over all - but the spacing between the cards doesn't go by the material design spec. Too spacey!,
Content,Probably the best app to view the quality content of HN on mobile devices. Can't get better - with the night mode and bookmarking feature. Just keep it simple like this. Loved it.,
Content,Dark themes! And it's a nice clean interface.,
Content, Nice looking but with great functionality. Lots of customization.,
Content,Works fine - but could really use an edit bar to put the Markdown in for you (phone is not the easiest to type the format codes with) - and I'd love to see a dark theme.  I'd give it 5 stars if it were a dollar - but I do expect a bit more polish for 2.50.  That said - it's working perfectly with my Nextcloud 12 install with Let's Encrypt certs.,
Content, I'm a long haul - when stopped at night - it blinds me when it's white. I like how fast it is.  There's some coffees that's coming for the programmer. Just work on little touch ups - like hen refreshing - it reverts to blue and white momentarily,
Content, Would really like the ability to actually tag people - and would also like a nice dark theme. Or at least let us customize the colors.,
Content,Probably the best Reddit app - it's very fluid with no ads and tons of customization.,
Content, Does have great customization options and nice layout but using this as a go-to isn't possible yet. Where this decides not to load gifs or pictures on mobile data others do no problem. Definitely has potential to be great.,
Content,Good app - open source - ad free. Excellent customization options. This is the best Reddit app out there - no questions asked.,
Content, So far so good. Easy to use. Love the customization options. Bought pro after a day and a half using.,
Content,The best Reddit app! I've tried them all. So many features and customization.,
Content,Fantastic customization paired with a fantastic layout makes for my favorite reddit app!,
Content, I would like a option of hiding NSFW thumbnails without losing post formatting and so that it also applies to nsfw subreddits. Also I would love to see a automated night mode like Sync has. Until then I'll probably stick with sync.,
Content, Auto night mode - customisable - ad blocker - Peek for links... constantly exceeding my expectations - amazing stuff!,
Content, All the features I've been looking for. Lots of customization - especially for homepage widgets,
Content,This app packs a lot of customization options and great features. Have tried going back to other reddit clients but I can't. This one is hands down the best (even when compared to Relay and Sync - imo). Occasional bugs but I'm not sure whether I should credit Reddit or this app for that.,
Content,Top tier Reddit app with lots of features and customization - no ads as well.,
Content, I haven't found anything that can compete with this one. Best features - best customization - and most regular updates with really good features.,
Content, It looks beautiful - I love the materialistic design and how much customization I can do to my pages. It's got everything I need with a Reddit - and it looks really good too. The devs told me my original issue was a simple mistake - so good on them!,
Content, This is a fantastic app! I remember when it was first released and it was super buggy - but now it has replaced everything as my favorite Reddit app. Also - yo dev - can we get an auto day/night mode pleaaasseee?? Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Âƒ,
Content,Favorite way to use Reddit. Good content cards - responsive - and nice material design inspired customization options.,
Content,The ability to preview customization settings is really nice,
Content, Excellent experience with AMOLED-friendly dark theme. Bingo!,
Content, I've been using this app the last weeks. I like it a lot. I love the color comments separator (although it has few colors - I'd like some more) - I really enjoy all the customization - and it has no adds!,
Content, More theming & customization options than other Reddit apps - works well - support open source,
Content, One of the few apps I've felt compelled to rate on the store. Buttery smooth - great customization options - and very very pretty design. My go to reddit app.,
Content, Many customization options to tweak it to your preferences.,
Content,I love this app - so simple yet effective and this sliding coupled with the amoled black theme is so godlike. I'm flabbergasted at its simplicity and customizability,
Content, This is best of all the bible apps I tried. Thanks for the good works.God bless u all. It will be nice if diffrent fonts are included and  background colours as well.,
Content, Books - bibles - dictionaries - split sync screens. Night mode. Great all round,
Content,I'm with others: excellent app for Android! But please get rid of the white bar that it's in the night version of this release. It's too bright.,
Content,Great with features adequate to my needs. If we could adjust header and footer color - I'd give it 6 stars out of 5!,
Content,it's awesome because it has so many features - is for free and everyone is welcome to contribute :) aaaand it has a dark theme!,
Content, Google sync - simple - no ads... but widget size fonts not adjustable (so big),
Content, I'm new to the app which is why only 3 stars (for now). Very nice initial impressions - will probably do some in app purchases. Would love to see some more customization to the widgets.,
Content, I have tried out almost every app in the Google app store - and was about to give up hope of ever finding one that fit my needs - until I found this app! I had even tried those GTD apps - and while good - I found this one even better!  It is easy to use - looks very nice (I love the dark theme) - and has all of the features I wanted! Thank you for this wonderfully designed - easy to use app!,
Content, Love it. All I need is wear support with a custom voice command - a la todoist - which just isn't as good! Keep up the good work!,
Content, I love it - keep it up!,
Content, All the features I want and need. I just wish the back button in the header bar was wider. It's very slender and hard to touch on both my s3 and Nexus 7.,
Content,No volume control for remote on firestick,
Content,Great open source video player but it doesn't have zoom feature like MXPlayer,
Content,please fix subtitle in chromecast streaming,
Content,It has a defect that wording is very small and cannot be zoomed,
Content,It had been very good until the last week or so when black mode stopped working right when viewing articles (as opposed to the home screen). Articles are showing up with very strange formatting with a white background and light blue font. forrmatting is OK when in light mode but that's hard or my old eyes.,
Content,"I use the app every day - but they keep making ill-advised changes to the UI. Nobody needs smooth-scrolling during ""find-in-page"" - it just zooms up and down awkwardly while you're typing. Also the table of contents swiping in from the right is fine - but it's way too sensitive--I keep swiping in the TOC by accident while scrolling vertically by *slightly* moving right-to-left.",
Content,There is some bug concerning dark mode wherein the text has a white highlight to it. please fix this at the earliest as the dark mode feature was a boon for Wikipedia - please don't let it become a bane now.,
Content,Uninstalled due to glitches with themes making pages unreadable & the article pages themselves becoming unreadable in parts even on light theme because of text normally at bottom of article overlaying portions of article and making them unreadable and developer not even addressing this problem this time.,
Content,STOP DIMMING THE PICTURES ON DARK MODE EVEN WHEN IT IS TURNED OFF !!,
Content,Good app. Has dark mode. Only wish it would store saved articles to SD ,
Content,Night mode doesn't work anynore. Writing is white but most of the background also - so one is not able to read the content. (Xiaomi Mi A2 lite) Problem fixed by new update - everything's fine! :),
Content,The app is the greatest out there - intuitive - straightforward - lite and productive... But for me - I have a technical problem which makes it unusable - the problem is that when I try to turn on the dark/black reading mode (night mode) - a white layer appears above the text of the article making it unreadable - at the end of the article - some elements appear to be not rendered correctly and out of order - the problem is local I guess - but I couldn't find any solution - so - help!,
Content,My wikipedia application has some problem with displaying content in night mode. It gives me white panels with unreadable text. My current version of Android is 5.0 Lollipop.,
Content,dark theme - offline content - syncing lists... thank you for taking this app from good to great. it my not be perfect - but thank you.,
Content,Some flickers - lags - and incorrect display of page contents are sometimes present - after switching from one tab to another. Otherwise - great. Please fix. Thanks.,
Content,Dark mode is broken in latest update. Please fix.,
Content,Articles don't display sometimes - returning an error of being offline. Some text appears to not display but does - the colour of the text is just incorrect for the background - which only happens on the Dark theme. The more this app gets updated - the worse it gets.,
Content,Why can I not change language anymore in an article.,
Content,"anyone else notice that the formatting is all screwed up since the new update? the bottom of the wiki pages the last bit of the page overlaps with the ""about this article"" section. Extremely annoying. and they still only have the history button available from the main page. Why do I have to go all the way to the main page to hit the button and see my page history? That's just incredibly inefficient.",
Content,Successfully strips most metadata (including the important things like ,
Content,Adds it's own metadata! The concept is to remove all metadata - so why remove it and add more?! New UI does make it more user friendly. Hopefully won't have to wait so long for the next update. (Remove 'ALL' metadata),
Content, And no stop button on main remote.,
Content, But there's no haptic feedback. Please add this.,
Content,Open source - simple and no bloat.  Very well done and thought out.  Dark theme option would be nice  S7/7.0,
Content,What a great little keyboard app!  The app is small on disk and RAM usage.  Even though the app is very small I was surprised with the customization options that were available.  Anyone wanting an efficient - lightweight keyboard should try this app.  My thanks to the developer for a job well done!,
Content,Overall good - but can be better. All the games run really really good - the sound quality - graphics and frames are great... For Nokia games. With Sony Ericsson ones - they dont work... at least none of the ones I tried. Maybe I got a wrong version - I dont know. But the main issue is with the control keys - which are really really difficult to edit. You can get individual configurations for individual games - which is neat - but editing said config? a pain the *ss Download this - it works - and its good!,
Content, Very good at what it sets out to do - display Korean verb conjugations and how they are formed - but it should  have the English meanings added - at the very least for the base form. Also the font size is too small and can not be adjusted.,
Content,Hi Lukas - just wanted to report a small bug - the Settings menu gets cut ,
Content, I can only guess the glowing praise is for odt files since this is no good for ods. Zoom doesn't work and can't change sheets.,
Content, I have tried several different players but this is the best. It has the prettiest widgets - has cool customization controls - is fast and clean (no annoying ads so far) - AND it scrobbles to Last.fm. It's totally worth the try.  I wish it had a previous/next button on the lock screen though - it's the only thing I've missed.,
Content,Basic functionality - some are broken (try zooming in to a graph as much as possible). New permissions made me decide to uninstall.,
Content, Would be nice if points of discontinuity didn't dissappear after zooming in - but I still think this deserves 5 stars,
Content, Needs inverse trig - needs degrees as well as radians for trig.    Edit: within 24hr developer had done the following from my original review... would be good to have pan and zoom on graphing (area of interest in a graph isn't always centred on (0 -0)),
Content, This great but still got annying bugs.cant zoom picture - if wan with friends using t9 keyboard -u cant type corretly,
Content, Can't zoom on pics - typing is hell-replaces words with periods -l and can't upload photos from gallery to Facebook using it,
Content,Photos are too zoomed in and huge now - can only see half the photo. Fix this - it looks awful.,
Content,Love the app and haven't experienced any problems with it yet. Only reason I give it four stars instead of 5 is because I know there are HD images available online for many of these. I'd pay money for an upgrade that would allow zoom with increased clarity. If not links to higher definition images online would be an easy addition to the app.,
Content,Really Awesome. i share the photos in pdf format to my friends. After zooming out it was great,
Content, I have paid for apps but none have been like this - great design - very fast - can zoom into table or view it as whole - can seach for elements(v.fast) - gives heaps for useful information for any level of experience and it's adfree and doesn't cost anything. Devs for this app are legends - for whom i shall forever be grateful,
Content, I installed Arch Linux the first time looking at the wiki with the Opera browser - but it was very slow and hard to see what was written. But I installed Arch again because I installed it incorrectly the first time - and heard about this app - and it was much easier to know what I was doing.,
Content,Best music player - flawless material animation - color customization - auto navigation bar tint. This deserves to be a paid app - donated to Dev for his hardwork!,
Content,cannot pinch zoom on received or sent pictures.. just shows white rectangle over image when attempting zoom.. I must Uninstall because of this.,
Content,Works great. Fast simple. Not too bogged down with customization - just ,
Content,the most private Chinese input method ever,
Content, Great app but since I upgraded my phone to the galaxy s3 - I've been having multiple issues with the zoom. Every time I try to zoom in - it actually zooms out. I have to restart the app just to get it to work right.,
Content, Gets the job done. The customizations options are wonderful. I had trouble finding my way back to the library menu sometimes. But overall highly recommended.,
Content, Impossible to adjust the font size finely. The ranges between two  neighbouring values  are too big. You can allow to enter the numbers manualy.  Sometimes the app launches at wrong page. The gap between the text and right edge of the screen can not be removed. It is still about 0.5 cm with the right margin set to zero.,
Content,A full compendium of valuable info. Prepare ahead of time to maintain ,
Content,hesitantly I d/l this - it was Not the keyboard shown n the Preview! Not even close! I wanted a keyboard w Control key - this was not present. Was looking for 'Samsung keyboad' like on my SG Tab2 which I love - unable to find for my Ellipsis 8. will just keep what I have and continue to Gumble! [gumble] I did Notice in the Sure of Use note - it warned that my keystokes would be copied - and my Passwords were @Risk -so I guess it's best I Uninstalled it & ran a deep invasive/security scan.,
Content, Just support regular language - not support VietNamese while in 'Select language' has VietNamese. Hope you solve this soon. Love you,
Content,Very good but there was eco teacher voice are breaking????,
Content,We cant understand what the teacher is trying to explain us,
Content,Nice for studying but the viedo wne audio quality is problem,
Content,Too long to share the file and other videos are cannot be played,
Content,"It's hard to use, it lags sometimes, and the audio is terrible...",
Content,"Make easy steps to upload voice recording, photos, videos and etc",
Content,I can't send voice recordings in it or even videos to the teacher,
Content,This app will contain very bad thing like Not clear voice graphic,
Content,There are some issus ... sometime audio is delayed some time video,
Content,"Horrible settings, laggy camera and I cant hear my teachers talking",
Content,"it is too bad device, perfectly not visible & bad sound & receiver ,",
Content,Couldn't connect to video and audio every time leaving from meetings,
Content,It took low network that's good but most time there is a break in voice,
Content,It's bad you cant even take a picture/video so you can submit it faster,
Content,I am not able to attach document or slides and not able open voice clips,
Content,omg... MY OWN TEACHER MUTED ME STOP ADDING THE MUTE BUTON I HATE SO MUCH,
Content,I am only giving this app three star because some time video don't play:(,
Interactivity, Overall pretty good app. Has alot of awesome settings. Would love to see double tap and pinch to zoom features and some improvements on the UI: like a book self and a recently books read list etc. But even now i believe its better from the most paid readers and all of the free ones!! Will give it 5 if some of the features i mention going to be added later on :),
Interactivity,Add an zoom option,
Interactivity,Only problem I'm having is zooming,
Interactivity, This is the best one I've tried so far.  The only issue is that the screen sometimes flickers as you scroll or turn pages.  I can live with that.,
Interactivity,Zoom feature please,
Interactivity,Option to zoom please,
Interactivity,Good app. Would like pinch and zoom though,
Interactivity, Overall I like the clean UI but it is missing some important features like zooming and some basic library functionality. I'd like to set a default location for my comic files and a way to mark comic books as (un)read.,
Interactivity,add zoom option,
Interactivity, Please add zoom buttons or pinch to zoom,
Interactivity, This app works almost flawlessly with one feature missing pinch and double tap to zoom.,
Interactivity,Add zoom..,
Interactivity,Best-looking. Push notifications mostly working but wish it could be better. When it works - incoming text will wake phone - turning the screen on momentarily with audio cue and phone vibration. NextPlus as fast as 2 seconds - Freedom Mobile: 20 seconds.  Other times wait 1 minute - even 8 minutes - nothing.  Yet I can open home screen - wait 40 seconds and notification suddenly arrives.  Concerned about not so much fear of missing out so much as wasting time and money because a meeting location changed and I didn't get the text in time. Not consistent enough for me. Might be voip.ms beta SMS network problem - not app's fault. Leaving voip.ms service for now to switch to Fongo - its app can wake my phone within 5 seconds - every time. But if using voip.ms - I recommend voip.ms SMS.,
Interactivity, This app is amazing - keeping my screens interesting every time I open my phone. However I was wondering if it was possible to keep the wallpaper to one screen? Or to have the picture not as zoomed in as it is now? Since I only have one screen (home screen) I cannot see the entire picture that comes up.,
Interactivity,I have been using this app for a couple years. I love the customization features. Adjust brightness - add blur - adjust how often the background updates - use your own images or have Muzie load from its library of images. This wallpaper app's quality and customization are still unmatched after two years (even with Google Wallpapers currently). Well done - Roman Nurik!,
Interactivity, I tried double tapping and the image doesn't change.,
Interactivity, I love the daily injection of painting - raising my phone from a functional - useful device to a mini art gallery. I wish however when you view the picture in the app itself you could zoom out to see the full composition rather than scrolling around.,
Interactivity, I downloaded Muzei at launch and also installed the Muzei - Reddit extension for it. This allows me to choose specific image-based subreddits (spaceporn - earthporn - foreporn - etc) to fuel the app's images. So far - it's been working great for me. Nexus 4 running Kit Kat.,
Interactivity, I love this app and I especially like how well it works with NowPaper. If it's at all possible it would be cool for Muzei to work with Tapet as well. The system you guys use for setting images as wallpapers works far better than what they have - because it doesn't zoom the image in.,
Interactivity,This app is amazing because of both the live wallpaper feature with interval options (and lock screen matching the placement of the scrolling wallpaper of the desktop) and the FADING of the desktop wallpaper with the ability to restore it to original with a double tap of the desktop.  I have never seen anything like this in interface customization and find it to be brilliant.  The faded desktop wallpaper is the persistent state - and restored wallpaper lasts a few seconds - with the timer resetting if you touch the screen (so you can look at the restored wallpaper as long as you like).  Finally - you don't have to use their daily art as your wallpaper and can instead use your own images.  I use a folder of wallpapers I've collected and have them change hourly.  Because of the ability to do this - this is hands down one of the best interface customization apps available.,
Interactivity,"Note to others as well as OsmAnd+ developers: When installing OsmAnd+ on my phone - I had the problem  that I could only zoom to 500m. If zooming closer - the map turned grey. This was because the ""Hide Overground objects"" setting was enabled by default. Deactivating this setting fixed the problem. I tried to re-install the app - and then the setting was enabled again - making it necessary for me to go and deactivate it before the app worked.",
Interactivity,Worked brilliantly during the last storm. The audible lightning strike alerts really wound my colleagues up a treat. (I also have Weatherbug installed but have yet to get an audible warning from it.) The map zooming needs debugging though. It can be painfully slow to resolve even over WiFi. This app performs well and on the whole apart from the map resolve issue I'm generally pleased with the performance.,
Interactivity,Works well but it continually plays my default ring tone as soon as the app is opened. Tried reinstalling but to no effect. Have to operate with sound muted. How can I stop it playing the ring tone?,
Interactivity, I cant think of any words to say. I installed a lot of text readers but this is terrific! You can change fonts - backgroud style and color and much more. If theres a ten star - this app will get one from me :),
Interactivity,I've used this app for about two years now and I've always loved it. I love that it's easy to adjust the size of the fonts and the background lighting and even the background color. I can read most of my stories and files in this one app. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because of something that just recently started happening. I had to erase my data from my phone a few days ago and when I reinstalled this app - i began to get lots of pop up ads as if I don't turn the page fast enough. I don't know if I picked up a bug and its just my phone - but since this is the only app doing it. I'm wondering if I now need to pay to stop the ads or what. if someone could let me know that would be cool. thanks for such a great app. I really do like it.,
Interactivity, Customization makes this app. At first I'm thinking it's decent - gets the job done - good enough. After tinkering with the settings I'm now using a completely new reader (scrolling - larger font - night mode - etc). Perfect for me now.,
Interactivity, Using it for months. Has a lot of options for customization... Good gesture control... brightness control with flick ... Dictionary integrations... awesome,
Interactivity, I really liked coolreader because it has so many customizations but recently it keeps crashing whenever I try to do anything other than turn pages while reading.,
Interactivity," (Droid Razr Maxx HD) This is the *best* *free* reader app. Tap zones let me hold it AND turn pages with the same hand - it's better than paper! Lots of customization. Reading RTF on Android is a miracle - plus all other formats except PDF. I have none of the bugs listed here. Finding files was unusual - but switching between ""recent"" and ""folders"" displays I now easily go from Books to Downloads and any other folder - just like windows. Yes some limitations but being free and so many formats it's worth it. &lt -3",
Interactivity,A great app - An excellent mod player. If you ever get the time - would be ,
Interactivity,"Overall good app. I love the clean and mimal look - the many graphs - the colour coding - the lack of limit on the number of habits you can add and the fact that you can change the order of the habits on the homepage. Some things I would personally love to see: 1) a cancel button for the batch edit of habit record (the ""edit"" button under history) 2) an ""x"" mark for habits that you didn't complete - I sometimes get confused with blank ones if I've not completed it or I've forgotten to mark it 3) an N/A mark option - for days when you can't complete a task - e.g. if you're on holiday you may not be able to practice music - so that your score stays constant Thanks!",
Interactivity," Basic functionalities are great: fast finding of passes wherever they are - zooming into code - etc. ... ""add to calender"" does not work for boarding passes from SWISS International Airlines - as they do not properly fill the flight dates ...",
Interactivity,Does exactly what you want& expect: Acts like an adds-free - cost free survival book guide on your phone. The interface is intuitively designed for younger generations who are too lazy to carry survival books or learn what's in them. There are also pictures and lists that are deceptively short and easily navigable.,
Interactivity, Overall I mainly use this. Only problems i have are if an app doesnt support undo i can accidentally press Ctrl instead of shift and then press A (selecting all the text) and then another key (wiping out all my text). This happened a bit in Evernote but they have added undo with Ctrl+Z it seems. Also the word prediction doesn't seem to work much - if at all - which is my biggest let down for this keyboard. Mar 2016: Now wishing that the transparent theme could have adjustable opacity so i can see through it more.,
Interactivity,Good app - but can you add haptic feedback when you type? Thanks.,
Interactivity,My favorite IME (keyboard) for Termux (a terminal emulator). Helps with coding as well due to easily accessible Ctrl - Alt - Tab - Esc - and even arrow keys!  It's a shame that (as a single example) Minecraft: Pocket Edition doesn't allow chat history with up/down nor tab-completion like the Java version.,
Interactivity, Freezes quite often upon opening. Works great when it loads. Would like to be able to double-tap zoom on images.,
Interactivity, Thanks for making this open source and available in countries that do not have paid apps. Great work keep it up. Loving the swipe customization actions.,
Interactivity,Loved it. Wanted to try this from so long but couldn't leave WhatsApp. Now that I've installed it I am loving it. Loved the dark theme - but whenever I open the app it opens in white screen and loads the dark theme on top of white. Need video calling. Thanks for archive chats feature. Big thanks to team telegram.,
Interactivity,This is a great app for watching movies. The brightness and volume controls on the screen itself is a very smart thing without having to slide down the notification bar. But why can't this player read the .mpg files. I would rate it if it could play .mpg files.,
Interactivity, The video is zoomed in and when we pinch it out.. It created a green box that is used for blurring.. But the things I want to blur.. Isn't coming in the screen view!!,
Interactivity, I tried this to redact a logo on a shirt in a video. The logo was mostly at the bottom of the frame which is overlapped by the controls. Every time I tried to move the blur square - it would jump the video around - pop the editor menu up... It was totally unusable.,
Interactivity,It would be great if it were possible to zoom in or zoom out with just one touch. Overall it's an excellent app.,
Interactivity,Great design - a high quality image rendering engine and good GIF support make Camera Roll a great gallery app. The only features missing to make it perfect are being able to sort folders by path - sorting by name and date in ascending as well as descending order - being able to disable folder close on overscroll and gesture controls for volume and playback position when playing a video.,
Interactivity,Ver nice app with great design ideas. Please add e ability to control video volume and track by swiping up and down - and left and right.,
Interactivity,One of the best free galleries for Android. Great for showing photo or art portfolios to clients. Zooms very high so good for viewing detail close-up. Very stable. Would like to see addition of auto-rotate - a grid overlay - and slideshow mode.,
Interactivity, Nice features - volume adjust - mp3 alarms - snooze time set - multiple alarms - been using it  for few months now.,
Interactivity,Very good app. Easy to set the volume and pick your own music to wake you up.,
Interactivity,Wish it had ramp up volume control - that it bypassed my phone's menu 4 easy snooze/dismiss - & had easier dismiss. Getting Gentle Alarm.,
Interactivity, Kinda like an app to view the facebook mobile site but better.  Can't upload videos though. Can't zoom pics.,
Interactivity, VERY COOL!  Pros:  No ads - pleasant sound tracks - independently adjustable volume levels.  Cons:  the UI feel cluttered and disorganized - a bit confusing to the first-name user.,
Interactivity, Dont get overwhelmed by the promising words of the dev.before installing -I must tell you that the minimum session length here is 20 minutes.maximum goes upto 2 hour.the sound could be deafening for you as they use very sharp frequencies along with heavy background noise.visual too could be streinous to the eyes because of rapid flickering.What I experienced was they tire us so much using the audio visual that we immediately fell asleep or totally get distracted.the time taken here is too much -now you decide,
Interactivity, I use this app constantly. Sometimes before sleep - sometimes while I'm reading - sometimes when I'm driving. I am an avid reader but sometimes I don't care for the choice of background music at my usual cafÃƒÂ©. When this happens I take out my headphones and run one of the programs. The app works extremely well and the option of adjusting the volume of the binaural beat and of the background pink noise is wonderful. I confess I sometimes just use pink noise because a little with closed headphones really gets you isolated and into a book - but I mostly use the Study and learning program. At home I have experienced lucid dreaming a couple of times - it does work. The highest mental activity is great when you are a bit down or depressed. For reading I've used Creativity and also Study and Learning - both work well - What could be improved? Well the background sound could be a choice of pink noise - seagulls and ocean sounds - moving train... But in any case - the reason I give it 5 stars is because nevertheless it's brilliant and it's open source.,
Interactivity,It's a good start.  UI on both Android and Windows is a bit clunky. Actually had the app become unresponsive on Windows when saving a one line document.  Aside from those issues - it really does seem like a good start.  I would like to see a Material style for better looks and usability. Also - I would like to have many personas for sharing - that way files can be shared semi-anonymously - and preferably without attaching an email being required. (I haven't actually tried this feature - only looked at it - so I may misunderstand it.)  Finally - features like OCR and audio recording/transcription would be nice in the future.,
Interactivity, I love the ability to toggle speaker and mute.,
Interactivity," App works almost perfectly! My only complaint is that when I mute or put the phone on speaker - my phone's icons don't change to show that either are active. Don't know if this can be fixed - but both functions do work so it's not a huge deal. The biggest issue I have is on the pebble itself - the ""All contacts"" selection does not work - it only shows a couple random contacts and cuts the other half off - and it always changes. Because of this I have to use a ""My contacts"" group to display all contacts",
Interactivity,Excellent app and one that I have been searching for a long time. I absolutely love how it extends pebble's call functionality but 3 stars coz of two major issues I am facing. When I activate mute or loudspeaker via the app - there is no visual change on the phone. The phone still shows as unmuted or in earphone mode. It makes me go paranoid thinking if the phone didn't go on mute. The second is when rejecting the call with a msg. I wish we could use canned msgs here. These two - I would give 5 stars and wouldn't mind paying!  Edit: Adding one more star for the prompt support and for getting confirmation that I can use canned msgs. But the visual cue on phone is sort of a deal breaker for me. Can I fix it with root? Also - I have an issue that after phone restart - even though notification service is enabled - the app says it's not and I need to disable and enable again. I keep my phone on mute most of the time and after a restart - if I forget to do this - I lose call notification on pebble.,
Interactivity, Once I rooted my phone - this app works great. It would be nice to be able to control call volume also.,
Interactivity, Great UI - 90% stable.  Needs probably slightly better control over sensitivity of voice activation (most sensitive option - not sensitive enough) and output volume configuration.  Access preferences whilst connected to a server also - as that makes it easier to tune the settings as required.  One crash for me - when wifi signal was lost. Probably needs better detection and trapping of connection state changes.,
Interactivity,If there's a current playing music - play button will appear and suppose to be pause button in the notification bar.,
Interactivity,please add gesture volume ( touch screen volume controler)  - and mp4 audio only player so we can play audio from mp4 video.thanks,
Interactivity,It's done its job. Edit: Would you (the dev) add volume control in Now Playing page? It's just that was very useful feature when my volume button broken. Thank you,
Interactivity,An outstanding app. Latest update allows zooming of video and gifs.,
Interactivity,Awesome for monitoring top while using an app - running quick commands - etc. The transparency is awesome. I do wish there was a way to launch it quickly - currently I've added it as a lockscreen shortcut so I can get it by double pressing power - tapping - and then touching the fingerprint scanner to unlock - but I wish there was a simpler way. I also keep adjusting volume when I don't want to - by exiting this with ctrl-D - where volume down is ctrl. Price is a bit high for an addon - but Termux itself is free and excellent - and the dev deserves a few bucks.,
Interactivity," I tried returning to the home screen during playback on my Motorola Defy+. I expected an icon in the status bar to control playback - but nothing appeared - although the music continued. My phone then became completely unresponsive... Neither the volume rocker nor the power switch worked. After maybe 30 seconds I got the ""Application Home not responding"" message - but it did not respond when I touched Force Quit. All this time the music continued to play flawlessly... until I stopped it by removing the battery",
Interactivity,I love the app - but after the upgrade of my OnePlus One to Cyanongen OS to the latest 12.-YOG4PAS1N0  (Andriod 5.1.1-(LMY48B) this application stopped working. It was fine till 12.0   What gives!   The NFC works - since the Google Wallet still does work without a problem.  Any help please? Update:  This app DOES work great on my Samsung S3 with the Android 4.4.4  - So clearly OS problem.  UPDATE: It is confirmed issue by other users. WORK AROUND: Turn DOWN the VOLUME to MUTE and the app will generate the temporary keys.  AGAIN - this is the Cyaongen issue - NOT Yubikey Update: OnePlus just released a new Cyaongen OTA OS 12.1 refresh and it seems that the NFC works - for the Youbico Authenticator without muting volume. Winning!,
Interactivity, Does the job - but many annoyances. Not consistently responsive to hardware headset play/pause button. Subpar widget on home screen - lock screen - and notification area (and why force is to choose only 3 buttons?!). I tried it for a month - but ended up going back to BeyondPod.,
Interactivity,Works great - shows book chapters - has volume boost and play speed. Also shows book covers which looks nice.,
Interactivity,"Great app but auto-plays when Bluetooth reconnected (even though ""auto resume"" is off)",
Interactivity,I would love the function to be able to separately control the volume - and/or to normalize or boost the volume. Some audiobooks are very quiet.,
Interactivity,I did not use it yet. I have a simple question: Can I control the book player with my voice  commands ? commands like,
Interactivity,great - very helpful but no volume control - at least on my phone.,
Interactivity, It took a bit to connect - otherwise I'd give it a 5. I finally had success with one of the 3 IP addresses (???) shown in Clementine's preferences. One handy feature would be a volume control - otherwise it's kind of cool.,
Interactivity, The Clementine app for Android is pretty great but it's missing one thing (as others have mentioned) - being able to access your entire library instead of just playlists - which honestly is huge. I don't think editing or tagging or deleting should be in the Android app - but just being able to see and load tracks/albums from the library would be amazing.  I also know this is a bigger task than most people realize.   I commend the developers and I understand that everyone wants something more - but if this functionality was added this would be a six star app.  The only other thing I can think of is a virtual volume control instead of using the rocker on my tablet (after a while those have to give out...virtual would be better).  Anyway - for a free app this is pretty amazing. For those who don't have definitely it try it out (it's free).,
Interactivity, I had to use a friends phone light to scan the code in a dark place - because there was no hint about the volume button trick to turn the light on  :),
Interactivity,Hey app is good but this update is only ok. You took the volume control away on the notification sound. What were you thinking? Not a good idea please finish the update returning the notification sound and then send it out again please. That would be helpful.,
Interactivity,I love it - only thing I would really like to see is a pause button when I'm in a song so that way if I need to I can pause or if I enter the wrong beatmap I can quickly exit it without having to let myself fail the map,
Interactivity,Almost perfect! Just needs for Shadowbox mode to work with gifs - and if possible video. Also needs scrolling through pictures in Shadowbox mode and Gallery mode using volume keys.,
Interactivity,Desperately needs settings to mute audio by default and change font and button colour to something less harsh than white. Otherwise - the ideal app for browsing Reddit.,
Interactivity,Autoplay feature wanted,
Interactivity, And the best feature is you can use volume buttons to count,
Interactivity, Works fine on both I tested on: dm7025 and dm7020HD.  But why is there no pause button on the virtual remote?,
Interactivity,Fantastic app! Keep up the good work!! But please add the 'audio' button to the remote. My dm800 automatically turns on audio description on HD chans,
Interactivity,Very useful camera...my favorite features is burst delay and front flash sadly I can't mute shutter sound,
Interactivity, Only feature I'd like to see is import for when you switch devices.,
Interactivity, Problem When you switch from voice to video or vice versa. It switches audio from headphones to speaker. When you go mute and close the app - then reopen - it shows you're not muted but you are actually still muted. It also locks up where it wont let you click anything. Anyways - Works fine for me - I use it to sip with other friends. I experienced minor crashes and the app is much smoother than before. Recommended.,
Interactivity,would be better if you could change the shape of the splashes when you hit the ground. also wish you could change the color and have a choice to mute the sounds. if all this changes ill change it to 5 star but right now - im not liking it too much.,
Interactivity,need option to delete files. need to fix volume controls and brightness controls in video mode,
Interactivity,the controls of the brightness and volume could be better,
Interactivity,Nice and clean. I wish switching back and forth between sources and addons - and the remote was easier. Also - a widget with playback and volume controls would be great.,
Interactivity, Lacking functionality that is found in the original XBMC remote. Vibration on press - left/right should be short step advance/rewind - a stop button on the main remote screen. Would like to see the ability to display notifications from selected apps.,
Interactivity, You can enter text using the phone keyboard and control volume with the phone volume buttons. Brilliant.,
Interactivity,So I've been using Kore for quite some time. It's been fantastic for everything I've needed it for. The only complaint I have is recently on Android Pie. The audio/subtitle quick button is gone. Where did it go? I used to be able to select and download subtitles as well as adjust subtitle offsets very quickly within Kore. Thanks so much! Edit: Absolutely correct in your answer. After using it more i realized that it does show up eventually and it does seem to be tied to the connection quality.,
Interactivity,Love this app but why switch the play and stop button!?! Please for my muscle memory sake change back!!! Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â€,
Interactivity,Very good remote app but why did you change the play and stop buttons in the latest update?,
Interactivity,Great app. Smooth photo zoom (unlike default Google app) and quick photo load in 100% quality (unlike Quickpic on Android 7-8). Double tap to zoom to 100% is very useful. I'll try to user it as default app - very promising. There are several issues that I've noticed from the start: 1. If I open some image - hide this app - go to home screen - and open this app again - it will start from it's albums view instead of displaying the same picture on which I left off. Very annoying. UPD.: Cannot reproduce it anymore. Strange:) 2. If I delete some picture - app will return to folder view but deleted picture thumbnail is still displaying. It goes away only after closing and opening this folder again. 3. Can't change sort direction (ascending - descending). I'm used to sort by name in descending direction - but app sorts only in ascending direction. There is a bit of a mess with timestamps - timezones - etc. - so names is quite useful for sorting. Also - I can't set different sort mode for different for different folders. 4. Current date or name is not showing while doing a quick scroll with scroll bar. It can make navigation much easier in folder with many photos. 5. Animation feels a bit slow (long duration). It's just my opinion.  Hope most of these will be fixed while app will be evolving,
Interactivity, Night mode - Pull to refresh - scroll to top and bottom - better font size control.,
Interactivity,I like rocket.chat in general. The updated app is kinda broken. Needs a  dark theme. Really needs a dark theme. A dark theme would be a good idea.  edit: Looks like lots of people are having connection issues. In my case it was resolved by settings on a reverse proxy. The app works well now.,
Interactivity,Good idea - but. . . Bad interface - no functions help - deat lock in complex calcs - no preferece menu - for example: font size - mantisa - colors - history,
Interactivity,I love the widget - but now it doesn't have a background. I need the grey background behind the widget to contrast it against my home screen background image. And I can't find the settings anywhere! What happened?,
Interactivity, Yeah this thing is great - it's appearance is just like the original android calculator but it's much more stronger. The only thing that's bothering me is when I want to move the graphics in the graphic panel - mostly it's the panel being moved - probably you can make the panel moveable only when your sliding on the three bottom keys. The same thing happens when I'm trying to zoom in & out the graphics. Oh and also as someone else mentioned - the time of key vibrating I'd much too long.,
Interactivity,I really like this app. Much better than the FB app. The web wrapper is a great idea. If you allow me to change the font size (like my browser does) you'll get 5 stars. I don't have a problem with it returning to top of news feed when you come back to it never because that's a feature of the mobile website but the front size thing is important to me. Cheers,
Interactivity,It needs a lot of improvements. 1) The app does not calculate brightness of a character automatically. There are too few characters in use by default - and in order to add more - you have to manually guess what they will look like. 2) The app does not know shapes of the characters - so it can't sub-character rendering like most ASCII art software - where you can achieve smoother edges by having outline of an object on a photo match a character's shape (e.g. a dot where an object is supposed to go through the bottom-left corner) 3) You can't zoom the pictures you took. 4) You can't choose a font with variable character sizes - you only have a monospace font by default. 5) You can't change font size.,
Interactivity,thank god that ugly search widget is gone - this was going to be five stars - but until they add a share function to open the current web page in another browser - I would stick with Firefox Focus. What's up with the web pages not dark mode?,
Interactivity,It's good but a subscription is required for changing theme? I want an amoled dark mode but can't. I feel like it might be better of having the optional stuff have a one time paid fee and then have a subscription for ads if you want a subscription. Also following the song isn't supported by google play music but that might be on googles side,
Interactivity, This new change glorious. Especially the functionality of the wishlist now. Add some customization to the new widget's ui and your gold.,
Interactivity,smooth and useful. More widget customization options would take it to 5,
Interactivity,Amazing music player with great ui. Better than every other music player. It has a clear and simple material design that looks great. There is tons of customization and a dark mode. Full version totally worth it and happy to support the developers! :),
Interactivity,Well I've been looking for replacement for the Samsung player and I've to say this has some amazing animations and its an absolute pleasure using this app. The customization is a cool idea. But if you could please fix the widget - Id appreciate it. Thanks,
Interactivity,Will you be adding dark mode and the ability to work while offline soon?,
Interactivity, I've tried many sms this one looks good. Couple of things would make a brilliant app 1. Allow contrasting colours. 2. Give avatars material design colours. If no photo. 3. Seems strange to scroll threads up rather than down. Only been using this for a couple will do a more in depth review after a couple of days. Having used this app for s week now its great but why does it keep calling people I text? Had to stop using this because it keeps calling people I text,
Interactivity, Transition are great!  UI is super friendly - and I like this BETTER than Textra.  But did I pay $1.99 to only get automatic night mode?  That was kind of surprising...,
Interactivity, When making changes to customize your app - like the font - the changes don't take effect unless you scroll up or down and then back. If it had more customization options like ChompSMS - it would be better and I would definitely pay.,
Interactivity, Opening a conversation is not smooth. Allow color options for bubble background. Also vibration customization options would be nice. I found a bug where received pictures looks wrong but when you click on it it is the right image.,
Interactivity, The overall design and the range of user customization is great - however I would really appreciate more animations and better attachment system. Currently switching back to default android L messaging app.,
Interactivity,Best SMS app i have ever used but it still has alot of room for improvement 1. ability to change each recievers icon colour according to its chat theme. 2. ability to change chat wallpaper to a picture if my choice 3. give theme header a different colur 4. provide various bubble styles 5. provide various various launcher icons,
Interactivity, Best of them all - and I have tried everything. Great customization and will actually have an option to wake the screen with a new message arrives - seeing that this is rare among 3rd party texting apps. Thanks so much for this app devs. Keep making apps that are as great as this one!,
Interactivity,love this app and the continued development love the scheduling of messages and the theming options. love the all black mode and how smooth this app is. i love that it doesn't drain your battery much at all. love that it's open source. i would say the thing i want most is online messaging so i can text from my Mac. making conversations private with a passcode required to open them would be pretty amazing as well. thanks developer!,
Interactivity, I love all of options and personalization.,
Interactivity, I've been looking for a simple sms with customization that makes sense!,
Interactivity, Hello team - loving the app by the way but the small font size is way too small to be called as small. Are there any tweaks you can provide to have it resize through percentage? 50%-200% instead of having small - medium etc configuration. Would also be happy if you may add the automatic retry resending when messages failed. Thank you.,
Interactivity,love the customization,
Interactivity, Nice interface - great customization - functions without a hiccup - what else is there to say?,
Interactivity,I'd love it if it could be - set to 1 line not 3 faster play and pause buttons were bigger,
Interactivity, I would suggest the following improvements:  Ability to change font size.  Mouseover text support so we can read xkcd and other comics with mouseover text.,
Interactivity, Please allow the changing of text size for the widget. would love to be able to swipe to change task lists. Please also color code the tasks for the different lists.,
Interactivity,"Good looking with lots of features but unintuitive and frustratingly slow to use. Ã¢Â–ÂªSaving to SD opens up possibilities for local sync eg with 'Syncthing' - with which it works beautifully. In fact the whole syncing side of this app seems really well thought out - and is a primary attraction.Ã¢Â–ÂªLove the dark theme.Ã¢Â–ÂªFont size - I find the notebook lists font too large when compared to the notes font - it would be great if font size could be chosen separately for notebook lists and note content. Ã¢Â–ÂªIt's very unintuitive and convoluted to change or edit anything - this is particularly annoying when trying to change 'State' which should be a one tap option. The complexity of trying to change anything is the main reason I don't yet use it for real. Ã¢Â–ÂªWould like an option to create a homescreen shortcut to a notebook. Ã¢Â–ÂªWould prefer that it didn't have Internet Permission - syncing is perfectly possible without. :-) Now has hyperlinks - and has got rid of empty ""Notebooks description..."" - thanks.",
Interactivity," Early impressions only so far - but this seems really good - intuitive interface and lovely Material theme. Unfortunately - the ""light theme"" option has a critical bug (on my device at least). When changing items in the side menu - the main screen text will randomly change to white Ã¢Â€Â“ unreadable on a light background Ã¢Â€Â“ and not turn back to black without switching to the dark theme and back again. Needs looking at. Great work otherwise - though.",
Interactivity,Please add customization ability. Thanks,
Interactivity,This is a great start and I'm really looking forward to future improvements. The ability to take screenshots of the view will be nice. Even just being able to freeze the view would be helpful. I'd like to see some preferences build in so the font color/size can be changed. On a cloudy day the white font is hard to read in camera mode.  What I'd really love to see is the ability to capture a scene - recall it later and be able to interact with it. If I could zoom into a picture and see the names appear on more distant peaks as I zoom towards them in the picture - that would be pretty cool.,
Interactivity,VERY awkward compared to either PeakFinder or PeakLens. The labels jump and flicker constantly - and regardless of this it is hard to identify which peak it belongs to. The free PeakLens app works flawlessly - and the pay-for PeakFinder is the best - imo (although PeakLens might be easier to use).,
Interactivity,Good straight forward calendar with not to many over zealous file-a-fax options.Ã°ÂŸÂ™Â‚ The only problem is whilst in the monthly view mode the optional (show weekly numbers view) default font size & colour - Clash's with both the monthly day count and the initialed days of the week row.Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Âµ Surely a font size increase or colour change option for the both the Weekly numbers & the initialed days of week row's would resolve these issue. Sending emails to guests without the owner's knowledge Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â•hmm.,
Interactivity,I like all features of this app - simple clean has all features that I need - but I suggest to developers - when playing video the gesture don't just vertically swipe to change volume and brightness but horizontally to scroll timeline also - and when I change background color to black - I can't see some icon on edit photo mode - hope developers can add horizontal swipe to scroll timeline in video mode and fix icon in black background mode.,
Interactivity,Needs 3 features 1) option to increase font size - 2) option to select by folder - 3) option to clear screen of other audio files while selected are playing.  When those work it gets 5 starsÃ°ÂŸÂ˜Â€,
Interactivity, Lets you choose between some fonts and some preset colors. Still needs the ability to make custom color themes and to set font size.,
Interactivity,How do you change font color?,
Interactivity,its good to be able to change the font - but I was hoping to be able to set a font size as I am using my tablet with a mouse in samsung dex mode - and I cannot pinch to set the font size. Also in termux in general - when in dex mode the keyboard wont pop up on screen when focus is set to termux,
Interactivity,Could we get an option for the terminal to remember size / position / font size between sessions?,
Interactivity, I just want to say that you did a great job on this app. I use it every night to lull myself to sleep. Problem is though - it's too bright! I had to find a screen dimmer app and it's still not a good solution. The app only overlays a black image over the screen set to whatever opacity you prefer. But that makes it difficult to see mistakes. I'd love it if you could invert the colors and change the white text and blocks to grey. Thanks for reading this!,
Interactivity,This app certainly has playable crossword puzzles - but the interface is very clunky. Moving between clues is unintuitive and broken - finishing words going down automatically takes you out of the clue order and starts you below the last finished word - and the puzzle zoom reminds me of websites in the early 2000s. By making the user interface smoother - this app would be great - but i can't get past how broken it feels.,
Interactivity,Overall - I enjoy the app - but there are several bugs that hold it back. Every so often - the selected tile will move down one on its own - or the zoom will decrease slightly for no reason. I've also become aware of the screen flickering very quickly while a crossword is open. I'm not sure if this is a new thing - or if I've only just now become aware of it.,
Interactivity, I love that I get to use my phone's keyboard on the app! That makes playing perfect! Please allow for a dark theme in the puzzle page so it isn't blinding to look for a puzzle. (white is just ugly anyway). Thanks for having the best crossword app there is!!!,
Interactivity, It downloads puzzles and plays perfectly. The features I use work. I didn't care for some of the defaults but you can change them - luckily. It would be nice to see the puzzle name above the clues - sometimes that helps in solving things. I'd like to change the background color in the puzzle list. Both are nearly white and difficult to read. Also - I've never seen a date sort work. My guess is that it sorts on the day you downloaded the puzzle and not the puzzle's release date. Hmm - possible update items?  Update: I touched a puzzle to open it and I saw the puzzle move to the right and off the screen. I was almost done with that puzzle - but could no longer it find it anywhere. So I began swiping the other puzzles and they too disappeared. I found a few in archive and swiped them again and poof - gone. What happened to them? I don't know - but now I'm mad and removed this program.,
Interactivity,You can say I'm kinda good At the Original PC Osu Game - But if its opsu - There is alot of problem - examples: 1 Can't stream in game 2 Cursor Sometimes Dissapears and Wont come back. 3 Small Circles blocked by hand and cannot see,
Interactivity,Fast - night mode - configurable - love it.,
Interactivity,Works well - but if I click show more friend list - I can't scroll up or down so I can't see all of it.,
Interactivity,No ads. Beautiful UI and complete UI customization,
Interactivity, but the idea isn't working for the LG G3 users - double tapping on screen is locking the screen - so can't see the blurless picture.,
Interactivity, When I double tap my wallpaper and it unblurs it should stay that way until I double tap again. Please implement this as a setting. Also would like to be able to change scaling.,
Interactivity, I first heard about this app from the creator of Dashclock. Unlike other live wallpapers - this app simply downloads images from the Internet and allows shuffling of wallpapers. The only customizations are applying a blur or dimming the image besides changing image sources or wallpaper update intervals. In addition to fetching images - predownloaded images can be used and shuffled. With a simple amount of settings and the ability to shuffle and get new images - high quality pictures are the center of this app.,
Interactivity," Used this on our Europe road trip. Worked great! User interface could need a hand on make it more intuitive (for example - I see the ""Download Spain"" message from time to time - even though I have it downloaded). Also - I could be nice to have a setting to set the detailed zoom level. In highly dense areas - the zoom level wasn't deep enough - causing doubt on where to go.",
Interactivity,Wow!! App but should have to pause button while video recording,
Interactivity,"Voice command ""Cheese"" does not work with Moto G6",
Interactivity, ServeStream works great! No ads - no cost.  Excellent free software! Scrobbles ShoutCast streams great!  Love the dark theme on my OLED display. Sends song metadata to my Kenwood receiver - and my Car Dock app.,
Interactivity,Good app with decent functionality. More control over how the widget displays (background color - etc.) would make this a 4 or 5 star app.,
Interactivity,Very convenient with a lot of customization,
Interactivity,Seems good - BUT no image zoom option means time to uninstall.,
Interactivity, Setting brightness - switching to night mode - exporting bookmarks - it's all very smooth. I'd like to be able to turn off internal styles by default - that's the only improvement I can think of.,
Interactivity, Can change font size and font at will - nice:),
Interactivity,I loved  the app and all features including the flexibility in layout. It supports all formats of e-books mentioned and there is also a night mode . Everything is FREE!! But it would be great if the page turning animation was made more realistic. That's the only thing lagging in Coolreader,
Interactivity, I prefer Cool Reader (CR) to Aldiko. CR changes pages by swipe as you expect - rather than by tap. CR has many background color & texture options. CR allows brightness control by swiping screen. CR menus are allways visible. CR seems to have many more configuration options. YMMV.,
Interactivity, Great reader.Especially useful is night mode & changing font size. Chose this app cuz could select books on extSD in current file structure & many supported formats. Never able to open mobi files that Kindle app could. Stopped using CR to select books as they were inconsistently sorted - use MyFiles which would suck more if the ratings - read - and to be read features worked. Stopped rating - adding series info - & renaming since info disappears. Even w probs would be best reader ever if PDFs were supported.,
Interactivity, I downloaded this app to read chinese txt files - it used to be able to do it on my other phone months ago. What happened??,
Interactivity,"A lot of awesome customizations - only app I can think of that let's you change the touch mappings of page turn controls. However - doesn't support mobi files and the UI is ugly as sin. There's no dedicated ""library"" or shelf so it's hard to have all books in 1 easy to navigate place.",
Interactivity,"Excellent - simple App for keeping track of day-to-day habits/activities/moods/events etc. Very quick and easy to interact with and includes reminder functionality which helps make keeping your logging with this App a habit itself. Ability to export all data as a .CSV is a major plus for anyone who cares to further analyze/visualize their habits. Widgets also look great. Night mode option is great - esp. for OLED screens. No ads. Free. Good job dev. The ability to annotate (add a text note) to particular days of an activity could be a feature that might improve the App. To keep the simplicity of interaction with the App and simple UI you could maybe do this by launching the text input dialogue on an extra long press of the ""x"" or checkmark for that day. Include these annotations in CSV exports.",
Interactivity,"Incredible app for making new habits s and replacing old ones. I've been using it for over 9 months. Make sure to go into the settings and tweak the app so that it works best for you. I would like to suggest one feature - however. I'd like habit groups. Itd be great if I had a ""Morning Routine"" group with all of the individual task within that header.",
Interactivity,Great design. Simple and effective. Love the night mode.,
Interactivity, Takes me to the website to download data files -  although will not select language at all. So I choose all languages - then sit there for over 10 minutes for a Web page to load anything... I'll keep it installed and try again tomorrow. Maybe there servers are being hit hard right now,
Interactivity,Lots of good information.  The biggest improvement would be to allow for pinch/zoom for images.  Will bump my rating to a 4 if this function is added.,
Interactivity,Awesome - thanks:) Any chance of supporting the headphone pause button?,
Interactivity,how dare you release a map app without pinch-zoom?!,
Interactivity, Dear Peter Osterlund - Thanks for your inclusion of autoplay option. Please - include Blundercheck & Arrows to indicate last move.,
Interactivity,stockfish engine is the best -please add Autoplay Button - Stockfish  -tcec 11 12 13 champion congratulation,
Interactivity,Very useful in Termux! Haptic feedback would be very nice - though.,
Interactivity, Great keyboard!  Not perfect - but almost.  It would be nice if we could adjust spacing on punctuation row.  Even more important is ability to override other apps - etc. - and keep fifth row open ALL the time!  Thanks for making this!  =^_^=,
Interactivity,"Not bad - but as there is already said - there miss ""select input method"" on long press on spacebar. As result - once i switch to hackers keyboard - to switching to standart android keyb or kii keyb i must go phone settings - language and input - and change default keyboard. That is very annoying.",
Interactivity, One of the main features for me are the cursor control keys. When you have big fingers on a phone or Tablet moving the cursor around from line to line - or character to character can be a problem. This was the only keyboard to address this issue that I found. Plus as a programmer the other built in features are great.,
Interactivity,This keyboard is the only keyboard app I can find having permanent notification to open it anytime even if I'm playing a game. Is there a chance Chinese language(at least pinyin input method) supported? Because I'm too lazy to switch keyboard everytime I need to use the language. It would be great if there's handwriting input too.,
Interactivity,awesome control and adjustable graffic,
Interactivity,can u fix light Flickering in dante inferno?,
Interactivity,As soon as i start up the app - a glitched menu pops up and flickers. The menu shows a colour of compressed blue and the game tab says the game has been compressed to 16:9. The app is completely unusable and I cannot interact with the app as far as i know of. (11/01/19) Redownloaded the app - now i get a dark screen on startup. Pressing the back button on my phone briefly shows the glitched menu - you know - the one i mentioned last time - before the black screen reappearing afterwards.,
Interactivity, I quite like this app. It's got a clean interface - generally smooth operation - and a fairly good amount of customization. The theme chooser is a nice touch. I love that it's open source. Realizing that it's still in beta - I have a couple suggestions. 1. It absolutely needs a scrolling widget. 2. An option to leave the main menu in the left pane in dual pane mode. 3. This is more of a quirk or bug - I suppose - but it needs to be able to be set as the default app for reddit links.,
Interactivity, Quite a few great customization features that I haven't seen in a reddit app before (mainly with the menus). I don't think it's at a point of being my default reddit app - but I see potential in it so I'll be following updates! A few features I'd like to see: swipe from left side of the screen to go back - right side to go forward (i.e. to last viewed link or comment section) - and then comment swiping similar to that of posts. If this becomes more polished out of beta - I wouldn't hesitate to drop $3 on it.,
Interactivity, Really great Reddit app. I love the vote swiping.  I've been having issues viewing some content within the embedded browser - but I just open those links externally.  My only real complaint is that the 'long press' menu appears frequently when I'm just trying to scroll down the main view. Perhaps a longer delay - or an option to disable long-pressing on articles (and access the menu items from an icon or something) would be a solution.  Finally - double tapping content to zoom-in would be useful.,
Interactivity, Turning pieces gets sticky and some times a piece freezes on the board and has to be canceled. Sometimes the tray overlaps pieces as they are used.  Very good clone of official online game. A.I. Has decent strength at higher levels. Well worth the memory space. =D,
Interactivity," Wanted to say ""simply beautiful"" - but wgen it comes to opening epub it acts clumsily. Besides there is no option for increasing font size. There is only zoom option which makes reading epub books difficult because you have to move the page sideways to read.",
Interactivity, Is it better than Astrid? Absolutely.   However - when I put in a task a month before the due date - and ask for it to be hidden up until a certain date - it doesn't show up on my list at that date.   Another suggestion would be to allow customization to the widget to let it show a certain task list.,
Interactivity,Months later and still no change. It is amazing what this developer has done. FEATURE PACKED (1) sync with Google tasks (2) tags (3) folders (4) notes (5) reminders / notifications (6) dark theme (7) various snoozes from the notifications menu. FEATURES LACKING (1) multi-select: cannot currently select more than one task at a time (2) NOW filter: cannot see all the tasks whose times are past due (3) cannot collapse the tags panel -- I plan on making about a hundred tags. There are constant updates but nothing that addresses the issues.,
Interactivity,The app is great yet there is this little problem since the previous update - although autoplay is off gifs and videos can no longer be stopped after played once :( i hope they will be stoppable again with the next update.,
Interactivity,1. It would be awesome to show last name and then first name in contacts - or - at least - choose it in settings. Also full names are usually cut while viewing contact. Could you make it two line or scrollable? 2. Compresses images - so that the text is unreadable - even when I send pictures without compression (through the file menu).,
Interactivity,when you pause the video and play again - the subtitles disappears. we had to close the app and lunch again. Please fix this. can't find subtitles button.,
Interactivity,It doesn't have autoplay option. Have to play songs specifically one after other.,
Interactivity,The little circle to the right that pulls out the contents is extremely inconvenient while scrolling - as others have pointed out - many of us end up dragging on it while swiping up one handedly. An option to move it to the left of the screen might be solve the issue. Also - since around a month or so ago - the app automatically dims images in dark mode - even when image dimming is turned off.,
Interactivity,"It's an intuitive app built with usability in mind. You guys nailed the tabs feature - ""table of contents"" button - fast scroll showing the TOC indexes - and so much more. Dark theme is also very important for me. I do have one suggestion. I'd love to see Wiktionary implemented so I don't have to leave the app. It would be great if I could click on a Wiktionary link and it were treated as any other Wiki page (open in new tab - preview - etc.). Anyways - great work!",
Interactivity,Pretty good - lets me read about mongolian fishing while on the go. Supports a dark theme and reading lists which are infinitely helpful. However - I do have some grievances with the new update: The new scrollbar is too distracting - and the table of contents sidebar is pretty awkward to use - because it's complicated to just take yourself directly to the section you want to go to. It just has you awkwardly skitter around the page. If there were an option to revert to the old table of contents - this app would earn a five-star rating.,
Interactivity,Issue: Scrolling bookmark is flickering and not smooth which is awkward,
Interactivity, My biggest gripe is the home menu animation the background - it's really bad - I wish it was slower - or it if was replaced with a static background. It's harsh on the eyes - but obviously - this is just a cosmetic problem. Also cosmetic is the fact that the zoom controls are kinda off - as in they are compressed-skewed. This might be a UI problem related to phone display aspect ratio and resolutions.  Choosing faces works fine - but when saving the image - it saves the image at a much lower resolution (this cannot be chosen). So I'm editing a 5M image - and it re-saves it to below VGA resolution. Sometimes - the pixellation or redaction are also slightly off-centered from the actual selection area. The video is also slow to process - but this might have to do with the phone processing power limitation (not the fault of developers). I'm assuming that not only does it individually process each frame - but it must be re-compressed and packed into a container file.,
Interactivity,Painfully counter-intuitive interface and the world's worst keyboard - what is with the stupid spacing around the cursor and why on earth can't you paste text into the input field? If you have a UX team - then fire them all - and if you haven't - then hire one quickly. It is badly in need of an overhall. Update - upgraded a star for not being crippleware like Plex.,
Interactivity,I opened the app and out of nowhere my headphones play a deafening static sound no matter the volume. Something's a bit off there.,
Interactivity,Brilliant app! No need to create an account - no hastle - just name - optional note - then scan or enter number manually. Love it.  Small suggestion would be to allow us to select a card logo or colour. Maybe a colour selector when creating a card that changes a highlight colour in the list and/or the background colour when displaying the barcode.  Also - my IKEA family card is 20odd digits long but the barcode image ends up quite crushed from the sides - and rotating it to landscape does not stretch it. Meaning it's hard to get the reader to read it,
Interactivity,Good job! Just a tiny detail - card note font size doesn't seem to work and note looks half-hidden until you tap it - but it's irrelevant. Great app!,
Interactivity, or add setting to change font size... if system use bigger size font... the notification just show partial of forecast.   Many thanks for your work,
Interactivity,would be great if if layout can be fully customised and there was haptic ,
Interactivity,Perfect! Can you add the option to mute the game itself?,
Interactivity,UPDATE: or rather the lack there of... This app is ABANDONED & crashes CONSTANTLY. The UI is amazing - and the 8-bit color option actually makes photos look better when viewing in app - this is the only gallery app I've found that can do anything to actually improve viewing quality of image. Would be perfect app if it didn't crash SOOO MUCH. I mean SOOOOOO MUCH. Also when scrolling through images - some randomly won't let you zoom in on them.,
Interactivity, This is just a niche request to an otherwise brilliant browser - but do you think it would be possible to add a force zoom function and quick disable Javascript from the browser menu rather than the settings. Great work!,
Interactivity, I tested the app with ODS files. They seem to open fine - sheets are easily selectable - zooming works fine - BUT graphical objects are not rendered. That's a pity please try to implement this feature,
Interactivity, Great for checking simple equations but it's quite limited both in UI andgraphing capabilities. There's a lot of panels to swipe through - I would really like to be able to change the axes limits (maybe a pinch-to-zoom gesture?) and maybe even show more than one equation at a time.,
Interactivity, Graphs need pinch to zoom and bolder X and Y axises.,
Interactivity, Try graphing y=log(x) and moving the graph around. You'll see it doesn't like to draw the asymptote properly all the time. Also pinch to zoom only really works in the y axis because in the x axis it gets confused and thinks you are swiping to another panel so only zooms a tiny amount! Keep up the good work!,
Interactivity,"Hi. First of all let me thank you for the continued support of the Alarm Klock application. I've been happily using it for many years. However - I'm very unhappy about the new UI. Everything is more complicated now.  Consider changing the time of the alarm (which is something I do often): previously you clicked the alarm and you could start changing the time. Now you have to long-click the alarm - then click the time - an only then you can change it. Why make it more complicated? What's the purpose?  Other problems: - maximum volume-increase interval is now 60 seconds. In the old app I used 90 seconds and I was happy about it. Why did this had to be disabled? What's so wrong about 90 seconds? - the ""increase/decrease by 1 minute"" buttons are missing. You now have to fiddle with the system keyboard to achieve this. Inconvenient. - icons are used instead of texts. App looks ""cooler"" but it's harder to determine which option does what. Again - inconvenient.  I use Android Marshmallow and the old UI worked perfectly for me. The new UI adds nothing - removes some functionality and makes other functionality harder to use. Please - please - PLEASE consider bringing the old UI back!",
Interactivity, This is great. It just needs pinch to zoom when displaying images.,
Interactivity,Awesome game. Very addictive. Needs a pause button,
Interactivity, cool idea easy app to use but images look kind of distortioned and would be cool to also zoom,
Interactivity, Easy to use doesn't crash. I like the new feature of using Google now. I can now talk the note I want while driving. My Bluetooth headset allows me to use voice commands. This works well with that.,
Interactivity, App fetches lyrics very quickly - and it looks nice. My only request would be to have the ability to search the lyrics (like Ctrl + F) also a night mode would be cool.,
Interactivity,It would be 5/5 if there was an option for static zoom on pdf files - cause right now it is very annoying to manually so every page.,
Interactivity,Not bad - it opens my ePub Manga - but doesn't scale the images correctly to the page - and doesn't permit zooming. It also doesn't respect to right-to-left setting of the ePub.,
Interactivity,Previous version was much better. Now the play/pause button is buggy,
Interactivity,Best input switching app. open source - no ad - and free. When you want to switch input method - you just need to touch the floating button. And if you want the floating button to stay in somewhere - you can move the button to a position and select fixed position.,
Interactivity, Was looking for something that allows you to build complex unit structures on the fly like Univerter did for Windows. Seems to work very well.  Input method is pretty straightforward and efficient.,
Interactivity,Input method not at all usable. Keep on scrolling like crazy. UnInstalling,
Interactivity, How can you not allow for zoom?,
Interactivity,it is realy nice - I loved it . it is  top  candidate reader  to be my favorite but setting the page tapping etc it is little complicated for  me - (For ex.  I couldn't manage to highlight a word to check the meaning in  the dictionary and i coulnt manage find the shortcuts  to set font size etc in one tap - i had to go to menu for each action  everytime). Maybe it was my bad - but it should easy for anybody - it is little complicated - As an opinion  -maybe there should be an easy user menu.,
Interactivity,"If you're looking for an excellent keyboard app that has NO ADS AND NO UNNECESSARILY INVASIVE 'PERMISSIONS' (like network-related access: Good luck finding another one that doesn't!) - AND you're willing to spend a few minutes worth of brain power to customize it (ex: downloading a free - language dictionary to enable the spell-check/word suggestions and adding any special characters that you like to the readily accessible ""Suggested punctuation"" bar) - then: THIS APP'S FOR YOU! :D If you're NOT up for a wee bit of mental effort - then have fun letting *whatever you type* and probably your 'Identity - 'Contacts' - 'Location' - etc. - too - be thoroughly spied on by the alternative keyboard apps! ""Oooh - but they have Emojis! Wheee!""  -p I've used this app since 2014 due to my Galaxy phone's too fast and erratic backspacing issue - and I've never had any problems since. The only thing that I'd love to see added is an option to selectively delete user-added words from the dictionaries -- even if I'd have to go into a separate setting to do so. (I'm fine with doing this - unlike the lazy-brained users who've ""tried"" this app - freaked out that they had to think and gave it a B.S. low rating - lol!) Thank you for this terrific app and please keep it up! Cheers! :D",
Interactivity, I really like this keyboard - and its the best I've seen for android - but I miss the vibration feedback.,
Interactivity,Update is great. Dark mode is beautiful. Only issue is opening a new page - it crashes.,
Interactivity,This aap is not bad but mi camera symbol is not coming someone help me,
Interactivity,Very bad l have lot of complain like my mice and camera is not working,
Readability,Very useful app to submit the assignment and best app to share the videos,
Readability,Very nice up... It could be best if sending voice message was also there.,
Readability, Does what it says for reading odt docs and has an edit ability to. The occasional doc seems to be outside the edges of the readable screen? - perhaps needs a bit of work there.,
Readability, Wonderful small widget and configurable. Contains various markets to choose from. Like it very much!,
Readability, The small widget is very nice - doesn't take much space so very useful  Dose every thing else you could what as well,
Readability,Great text app - but the recent update seems to have broken picture ,
Readability,Super lightweight but functions perfectly! This is exactly what I needed on my old - beat-up phone. I like that you can easily archive messages and I like that it has a quick reply pop up. The only small thing I'd like added would be the ability to more easily open the full conversation from the quick reply. But that's a minor complaint - you guys did a great job! Thanks for keeping it small and looking great on night mode.,
Readability,"Great for use with ""Should I Answer"" - but Blocked Numbers should be on the ",
Readability, Settled on this app after trying several others. Simple - fluid design with all the most common conversions readily accessible. Doesn't need any permissions and it's ad free. Recommended.,
Readability,Great app... simply understandable to all,
Readability,Great - nearly QuickPic. Bought the Pro version but a bug renders the top info bar on long press select unreadable. Could result delete what your plan to share. Needs a fix.,
Readability, I would rate it higher - but every time I touch the screen it zooms so far out that it is impossible to read.  Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1,
Readability, I love the puzzles but as of today I am forced to do the puzzles zoomed out. This makes reading the puzzle very difficult. When fixed I will give 5 stars.,
Readability," I'm giving 4 stars but would be giving 5 if this latest revision didn't do something weird on the ""Clues"" view. The Clues bar is super zoomed in and I have to scroll right and left to see how long the word is. Nothing I do fixes it. I'm on Android S6.",
Readability, This is a great app for crosswords - but I constantly get an issue where the crossword board zooms out to the point where it's unreadable.  If I zoom in - any button tap will zoom it out right away.,
Readability, This was a great app until the zoom bug creeped in. However - it is open source and another developer had forked out a version that fixes it: Words With Crosses.,
Readability, Is a great apparently but please fix the zoom and sizing issues...to hard to read with my eyes and constantly fighting to zoom and resize.,
Readability, The zoom feature still doesn't work.  It makes the app unusable.  I'm using a galaxy S II,
Readability, About 5-10 minutes into the puzzle - the puzzle zooms out and i cant read it. I zoom back in - but it goes out after clicking the puzzle. The problem corrects after uninstalling/reinstalling - but resurfaces before i can finish my first puzzle. Uninstalling for good. (On Samsung Galaxy S III),
Readability, I love doing crosswords during my lunch breaks. Thanks to shortyz - I don't have to bring a big book! My only complaint: sometimes when selecting a square - the zoom spazzes out - making the whole puzzle black. A long tap to reset zoom fixes it - but not until after it calms down.,
Readability, Very good app and packed with info. This has a zoom function - but as it is by a non-standard method (long hold - then slide) it is not obvious. If the zoom were more intuitive - this would be 5 stars.,
Readability, Simple - understandable - and clean.,
Readability, Stylish and easy to use,
Readability,I like your service in general - but the UX of your app is outright horrible. Messages are permanently zoomed in - like way in - and there's no way to zoom out. Moreover - scrolling can only be done in one direction at a time - making it near impossible to read emails that contain html.,
Readability,"Built in browser is extremely poor - no zooming - very hard to scroll horizontally on certain elements - doesn't format text for mobile. At least half the time I have use the ""open in browser"" feature just to read the article. The comments section is also not great - comments can have their children collapsed - but can't themselves be collapsed - so this makes browsing threads with lots of replies a real pain - especially because long comments have a tendency to jump back to the top of the comment when you try to scroll them.",
Readability,Easily better than the actual reddit app. A lot more options for ,
Readability, Simple and easy to use,
Readability,Would have given six stars if possible. this app is real handy and it's extremely accurate. Interface is terrific - simple yet effective with a bubble and a large readable level in lansscape and digital display.,
Readability,Easy to use - easy to read very adaptable.,
Readability,Very easy to use! interface is very readable,
Readability, I appreciate the openness of this Bible application. Thank You developer Martin Denham.,
Readability, Can't zoom in/out when reading -pages are not centered.can't go to next page and sometimes it gets stuck in the middle of both pages.,
Readability, good but ....... zoom is not available to read properly,
Readability, Great reader - the only feature it's missing is the ability to zoom - but if  that means faster loading times I'm happy.,
Readability, Seriously - it has no glitches but that's the one flaw it has: you have to change zoom through the settings. Otherwise great - legit comic reader,
Readability, I wish it was possible to adjust the font size - sometimes it's really hard to read street names.,
Readability, OK this is a royal pain to install. Once installed make sure you fully kill the osm process then restart the app. You can then download the contours. Unfortunately the colours chosen for contours is the same as other items on the map so on villages and towns they simply vanish. On the upside it's cheap and the files are small.,
Readability, White noise is a little too bright for me. I can adjust the higher tones to make a blend of brown/pink noise. I love it!!,
Readability,I can't import KML file in google maps - so I still can't see what I've found after I close wigle wifi & wigle won't open its own KML file,
Readability, The map disappears if zooming - showing blank white screen with scrollbars. Map of Moscow metro is so outdated that I couldn't use it: new stations are missing - some of stations have wrong names. Choosing stations right on the map doesn't work too.,
Readability,It is still my absolutely favourite reader - though for some reason it fails to save my font size settings. Every time I exit the app and open it again the font jumps to the tiny 33 :(,
Readability,Does'nt keep page setting. Text impossible to read...,
Readability, I'd welcome simple voice commands 'next' - 'back' - 'exit'. And support for .pdf. Otherwise this is my only app for reading.,
Readability, Fat with a nice interface and nearly as much customization as Moon Reader.,
Readability, Just what im looking for...reading on phone was difficult especially with small fonts. But with Cool Reader - the font size is adjustable and still fit to screen not having the need to scroll left and right. thumbs up,
Readability, Simple interface -reads a variety of file extensions (not only pdf and epub) - and has customizations fit to user's different preferences!,
Readability,Used to love it but on my new phone (Gslaxy S 5 w Android 4.4) the font size keeps resetting.,
Readability, was excellent but it stopped to see books on extCard - why? no such directory in the root anymore. 442 - Omega-XXUENB3.,
Readability, More fonts will make it even better,
Readability, Slick layout and design and very functional but it sometimes just throws away a letter - word and sometimes entire sentences. Some books the text size just becomes massive halfway through.,
Readability,I love all the user control in this app.  Being able to choose the font color is the greatest!  And the color choice is infinite.  Font size and font style are more limited - but with more than enough variety for this picky reader.  The background choices are amazing - solid colors - patterns.  These are just a few - but VERY important choices not available on any other reader app I've checked out.,
Readability, Does everything an ebook reader should - packaged neatly and full of customization options to get it just right for your ease of use. Particularly like the implentation of night reading mode.,
Readability, I wish I could give it five stars but it has some problems that need to be fixed.  And I wish there was a quicker way to zoom fonts.  But I can find no other reader that let's me read epubs AND can properly read .txt  file books.  With pure .txt books - Cool Reader deals with the wrap around and indentation perfectly and even manufactures a good table of contents and bolded centered chapter titles.  And - very importantly to me - it let's me read in 2 page landscape view.,
Readability, Text-to-speech works great.,
Readability, Switched to the new phone and CoolReader stopped to save font size settings. I set it to 48 but after some time it resets back to the default.,
Readability, This is a great companion for Smoothsync for Contacts and Calendars. Just give us an option to change the font size please.,
Readability,It is one of the best habit trackers out there and I love that you develop a habit in percentage increase over time. This particular feature is very well implemented. I wish I could increase the font size and size of the progress circle to give both more presence.,
Readability,Simple and effective. Plus - there is a dark mode which is always a must.,
Readability, Great job! I'm poor and I can't pay a data plan.  Is it possible to change the font size?,
Readability,Cool app - in the settings - day mode changes the background to light - but the font still stays white too - meaning you can't read it!,
Readability,I love it! It's missing three things though: The F row - emojis and the ability to set the default language.,
Readability,Great job on the key spacing and the word suggestions,
Readability, Please make an option for bigger text. Otherwise great,
Readability,perfect PDF reader for phones. great features including night mode and,
Readability,the graph colour and line is so light and fine it's unreadable,
Readability, Very usable - rivals Google Reader and its associated app. Only thing missing is the 'labels' functionality from the online service.,
Readability,The Oct. 29 update removed one of essential features of Wikipedia: hierarchical display of the table of contents. As of now - all contents are listed with no reference to which headings are subheadings of other headings. As a result - in long articles the table of contents is of very little use due to its low readability. Please reintroduce hierarchical display in the table of contents. It is a critical feature of navigation and essential for getting an overview of the article.,
Readability,Simple and small app so great in those regards. One question... when adding a widget - the text is black which is hard to see against my dark wallpaper - text on all my other apps is white - can that be fixed?,
Readability,The app will not even show much of the folder names. The white font is difficult to read and should be able to be changed colors. The app icon is black & red which should be able to be changed to different colors. Plus it shows my folders in two separate lists alphabetically ordered for some reason.,
Readability, Overall impressed with the layout and style of the calendar. I wish agenda widget can be polished more with customisable options like transparent header - text size of agenda items and day header.,
Readability,Etar is a straightforward open source calendar. It works like the AOSP calendar with the ability to write in events and sync to other services. The additional features compared to the stock AOSP are a cleaner design and some night mode features for those who want it. Overall it's an easy to use calendar with a clean design that works like the AOSP calendar.,
Readability,Excellent app.  Been using it for years on many different phones - to automatically read my text messages though my cars Bluetooth voice stream.  Just wish it could direct my google maps voice commands through the voice stream as well.  Hopefully some day.,
Readability, Love this alarm clock.  My favorite is the slowly increasing volume so as not to shock me awake in the morning.,
Readability, Other alarm apps have pretty candy coatings - but they are a pain and limited on customization. This gives you repeat options - easy tone selections - and customizable snooze length. Easy. Works!,
Readability, Would love to see a Sickrage app implementing subtitle management - and some shows don't display any episode info (stopped shows). Otherwise great app.,
Readability,Installed on Motoro XT1045. Initially I liked the appearance and customization but soon experienced glitches. The most annoying one is that the keyboard keeps disappearing at random times while typing. This makes the app unusable. Second issue was that I was unable to send video MMS. Went back to the stock messaging app - which is not customizable in appearance but at least is reliable and let's me type.,
Readability, It didn't allow me type commands and it has forgotten all the history.. volume up isn't working as expected,
Readability, Sometimes it doesn't update the queue when I hit my WiFi. I'm not sure if autoplay if the best default for podcasts.,
Readability,Great app - my only wish - feature request - the ability to add notes - timestamps and subtitles. I listen to a lot of lectures.,
Readability, Some audiobooks are very quiet and I can't increase volume. :-( Must change for another app I think.,
Readability, Especially about muting the bright comments colors.,
Readability,I Love It... It Would Be Even Better If It Has An Option To Change Fonts On Stamps,
Readability,Lower font size for GPS tag is needed size 3 would be nice.also if you can make text a little transparent that would be really appreciated..thanks,
Readability, I want to be able to zoom in to see the ssids on the map - but no matter how far I zoom the rest stays the use size.....ultra tiny and impossible to read.  Still very cool though. Stable and fast.,
Readability, Has various font sizes and brightness options.,
Readability,The reader is really good - with many customization options - however it is no that user friendly.,
Readability, I've been using this app for over 3 years!! Thank You Vadim for such a smart and user friendly reading application. I like night mode - you can adjust the dimness to your liking. Great to read when the lights are low or off. I read alot of epub. I like this app better than kindle. It always opens up to where I left off on the current book I'm reading!! Excellent!! Device=Kyocera Hydro Edge.,
Readability, Seem that it is not working  every time I use need to set font size,
Readability,Dumbs down QrCodes - makes them unreadable.,
Readability,Ringer can't be muted. Nice logo!,
Readability, The keyboard is impossible to read. They tried to put all the keys on the screen - but it's not deaigned for older eyes.  I couldn't get the maps to show on the screen so it's deleted.,
Readability, I really needed a Control key. Thank you!,
Readability,Sony Xperia Active with Android 4.04. Free - no adds - simple - clear. - highly readable even on my tiny screen  It is just a barograph displaying the raw pressure sensor data. X and Y axis labels and grid lines are clear and well spaced. It is possible to move on the graph to see past recorded values. Reasonable foot print: SD storage: 2.1 MB - internal storage almost nothing - cached process memory 2.3 MB. The application intermittently and randomly stops recording hence 3 stars. If this was fixed - 5 stars,
Readability,forward is an issue. subtitle fonts and color gone? lock should not tilt screen.,
Readability,During a cast subtitles dont catch while watching can you please fix it.,
Readability,My only concern is when casting to my Chromcast subtitles not showed,
Readability,the subtitle file doesn't show while casting your video eventhough you have an option. i think there is a bug,
Readability,New version - cant browse subtitle.. Keep hang when I tried to browse subtitle,
Readability,I really would to give to this App 5 stars but isn't well coded for Android ,
Readability, Ok - but the list of files is unrreadable. They are tiles in 3 column with the file names cut short.,
Readability, I really love it. I have a couple of suggestions. Please 1) add a true full screen mode (hiding the bottom android bar) - and 2) make web page background color customisable like in uc browser - it's vital for reading.,
Readability,Inverted colours + dark themes + TEXT REFLOW = excellent browser,
Readability,Ads in the way can't see whole documents. Sux,
Readability,No font size selection,
Readability,That graphics are ok...but only one map and since any tooltips are missing it took a while to figure what does what...more maps - more infos and it is a great game,
Readability,It works well but would like to have a dark theme option like the PC/web versions,
Readability,Good start but has many problems. Every time I open addi font size gets smaller until I can't read anything anymore...,
Readability, The transparent Widget is no good for real usage - it is difficult to read,
Readability, After the Lollipop update the widget has become unreadable. Great a] otherwise.,
Readability, Dark theme? Or even something that'll read theme values,
Readability, Lollipop turned the widget into a black mess.  Unresponsive - ugly and unreadable.  Pitty - because it was great a day ago.,
Readability,I wish the widget wasn't transparent. It's too hard to see against most phone backgrounds. I also don't see any themes other than default.,
Readability, Nearly perfect - but I wish there were either a light mode or color customization. The black background on white text is a bit dark for my taste - especially during the day.,
Readability, This is how every app in the market should be. Offer a free version that does the base function - then offer a paid app that goes above and beyond. The additional features here are fantastic. I hope many people choose to support you. Something I would like to see is more skins. The Titanium skin is nice - and is cool to show off - but it's almost not functional because it is hard to read. I would like to see a skin similar to the titanium that is HD and high contrast. Great job on this emulator! Thanks!,
Readability,Would be perfect if I could adjust font size,
Readability,The font size has drastically increased in the recent update. Now when changing the widget size - the font is either tiny or huge.,
Readability, Markdown: code highlight - tables. And maybe administrator area? Oh - and light theme will be good.,
Readability, Does not require access to everything on your phone unlike FB app. The one thing that could be improved is allow scaling of content for easier readability. Fonts are a little too small on my tablet.,
Readability,Adjustable font size - please,
Readability,Not able to adjust font size,
Readability,honestly love the app love the night mode and how it tells you what its blocking!,
Readability,I can't read the lyrics because the ads keep popping up in the middle of ,
Readability,Small font.i can't easily read the lyrics. UI is clustered with futile ,
Readability,"Works well although a free dark theme would be nice. And the metadata of the music has to be entirely accurate or else the lyrics won't be found. The floating button should be smaller and transparent. It can't approximate music titles very well if there are extra words in the title like ""lyrics"" for example although sometimes it does.",
Readability, My only wish is that I could change the font size when looking at card descriptions.,
Readability,Simple and app. 5 stars for open source - dark theme - no ads - not bloatware - nicely run on Nexus 6P with Andr 7.0.,
Readability,The PDF mod is fantastic. The reader itself is beautiful and simple. But can you add options to hide the progress bar and to make the background color white? This way it would be perfect.,
Readability,Very nice - super simple reader - wish it had a few extras like a night mode - but ... Great as it is - so I'm happy.,
Readability, Straightforward and simple. I haven't used the alarm options yet - so cannot evaluate that.  But so far a pleasure to use. Also I love the dark theme option!,
Readability,When will the old black theme be available again? Gray background is rough to read in certain lighting conditions and with some font colors.,
Readability, Excellent mobile companion to the quassel suite.   My only beef/request is I wish the dark theme was black and not dark grey as a background.   The grey makes it nearly impossible to read some of the colored text.,
Readability, It is clean - simple and I haven't found a single issue concerning to the font size - specially code blocks.,
Readability, Exactly what I was looking for - lets you change font size and has very nice formatting,
Readability,Extremely helpful resource and definitely handy to have access to on the phone.  I'd like to suggest a dark theme if possible - for readability.   The light theme hurts my eyes after staring at code all day.,
Readability,True minimalism - not just by design - but by resource usage as well. Uses little battery power - and package size is under 3 MB. The only other feature I'd like to have is customisable notification colours - because the hard-coded black text is impossible to read while using a dark SystemUI theme.,
Readability,The notification bar alignment has a problem. The song name and artist name are almost completely hidden. I can't see the name of the song being played. Please fix.,
Readability,Developer please make background blur when we touch on the album so that lyrics can be readable.,
Readability,Cool app. Is it possible to make the diff font size adjustable?,
Readability,Night mode. This needs it. Great reader though,
Readability," One quibble. The outline around ""comment"" in the title bar overlaps with share icon. I know it's supposed to indicate a button but it's weird.",
Readability, Really fits my night mode rom.,
Readability, Please add options for larger fonts though,
Readability, Everything works really well with the exception of night mode. Occasionally the text of some of the messages are black - while the text of others is white (which is a lot easier to read),
Readability, Better customization options than textra,
Readability,Very simple and clean app. If only everything had the customization of this. Awesome for saving power on oled based displays - and for saving my eyes at night.,
Readability," This looks great and does everything I want... Except: I can't see how many characters I've typed. Also it would be nice to see a ""received"" notification on the status bar when I send a message.",
Readability, Formerly used Textra - Handcent SMS - Stock Messenger and a bunch of others. This is so slick looking - operates cleanly - and doesn't take up too much space.  The preview feature is so handy and convenient.  Night mode is wonderful.  Gladly paid for the enhanced version.,
Readability,Had been my go to SMS app for years and the new update is very nice. Only minor niggle is that since the last update the settings seem to have lost a lot of options (font size etc). Still the bestest app though Ã°ÂŸÂ˜ÂŠ UPDATE: New update released today and font size is back :-) How quick was that? lol. Many thanks :-),
Readability, Full customization. Material Design. Night Mode. No frustrating notif about 70 character message.,
Readability, But sometimes my font changes color. I have a dark red text background color for me and sometimes what I've typed is white and sometimes it's black and hard to read. It's random when it does this too.,
Readability,"Excellent. I notice setting BG to black - Color to dark -dark green - and Focus to very-light - saturated green is most readable for me (the eyes are most sensitive to green light). The way this app carries the highlighted region across is more natural than the ""single-word"" approach because the former closely resembles actual reading. Also - how it pulses as it scrolls across the horizontal forces the eyes to stutter - microsaccades strongly modulate neurons in the primary areas of the visual cortex.",
Readability,Seems good but hard to get going due to light grey on white low contrast text. High contrast text option needed for readability and to prevent eyestrain. Looking forward to future updates.,
Readability, No night reading mode - no choice of font size... I'd pay the premium price tag if this app was as good as gReader.,
Readability, it's a good app but i have proplem with some arabic site i didn't have this issue with google reader the problem in the articles with arabic and english the arrangement of the article is not right and it's impossible to read it correct this issue is on both pc and android can you solve this please thanks !!,
Readability, Very fast. Would love to see some reading options like dark/light theme - a more compact view and may be some customization with the lists. Still a solid app and the better option if you're using Newsblur on a mobile device.,
Readability, need dark theme - mark unread command - img view - and most important full TEXT fetching without browser open and in the background!,
Readability,The ability to read offline and dark theme (with all of the original features) make this one of the best rss readers,
Readability, Great and use it daily but I would love a dark theme for the app to make reading in the dark a little easier on the eyes.,
Readability,My goto app for reading my news in the morning! Only thing - since the Android P upgrade - when using the dark theme - the type is very hard to read since it's in black on a dark gray background.,
Readability,Recent convert to Nextcloud from a big - commercial offering. Really liking the whole environment. Android app's been working well for me - only issue is that it sometimes hangs on the loading icon when trying to browse files or photos. Guess this could be a server connectivity issue - but there's no easy way of knowing. Be good if there was a message saying what's going on while the loading spinner is displayed. Would also appreciate a dark theme - I find these far more legible and they're more efficient for my OLED device. But on the whole a great piece of software. Thanks devs.,
Readability, Love this app - its functionality is second to none - however the last update has ruined the dark widget for me. When placed on lighter colored wallpapers - the dark widget doesn't have enough opacity - and it makes the white type used practically illegible. Please fix this. There was no issue with the widget in previous versions - no need to change it - especially when the change in opacity has made it more difficult to read.,
Readability," Love this app - well love the idea. I have the same problem as some other users in that the OK button is grayed out and I cant save anything I input in the ""up arrow dialog"". Also I don't see colors or the graph like in the screenshots. Finally when inputting a new envelope name - the text field appears black and is unreadable. Would gladly give 5 stars once these issues are fixed.",
Readability,This would be great if there was a way to disable line wrapping.  Most of my org files contain tables - and when these are wrapped they are completely unreadable.  Any chance of making wrapping optional?  You could scroll the document left and right just as you scroll up and down.  Then this would be awesome!,
Readability, My eyes are bad and I would love a way to make the font size bigger. On my galaxy note tablet they are smaller than in the posted screenshots. Perfect with update! Thanks! Changed my rating to 5 stars.,
Readability,have used this for a few years. excellent development and regular improvements. would just like to see custom background colour setting  - global or per notebook. Also an option to insert inactive timestamps like [2019-03-30] without having to type them.,
Readability, Only major ports listed. Secondary port tides would be desirable for recreational users. The tidal curve graphic needs improving. The font size is far to small and difficult to read. Some colour and formating to separate days would be helpful.,
Readability, I suggest it should has bigger font size.,
Readability, It's awesome just a little nitpicking on my end - the blue font color when highlighted while in dark theme mode is a strain to read (as seen on the 2nd pic of the app) . If you could just maybe make the highlighter pure black (in dark theme mode) - that would be awesome - I will definitely even change my rating to 5 stars. But nevertheless - great application Ã°ÂŸÂ™ÂŒÃ°ÂŸÂ˜Â€,
Readability, Ive played the original Pixel dungeon and Remixed Pixel Dungeon but neither can compare to this one! The HD fonts - scaling - additional shortcuts and no weapon degradation really makes the game so much more playable without feeling too burnt out by RNG. This game has a permanent spot in my Smartphone!,
Readability,Once mastered easy to use and read. Useful colour coding. Has become valuable addition to the mobile.,
Readability, You could at least make the scroll bar bigger so I could at least use it. Now it is so tiny that it's even hard to see it...,
Readability,Basic Linux terminal but I don't recommend installing it on your phone unless you want to go blind trying to read it.,
Readability,The main problem with this app is font size! Please let us adjust it for better experience...,
Readability,Mostly good. Please change the notification to not hardcode the black text color as it doesn't contrast on dark themes.,
Readability,Does what it says it does but the main reason I got this app is so I can change the font size and it looks like it can't do that Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â”,
Readability,Need option to control font size,
Readability, It's nice to be able to choose the font - but that's not so useful when the text is too small to read.,
Readability,Like others - I bought this to support the dev and would love to see user defined customization and a selectable font size.,
Readability,I haved used this app for years on various tablets and versions of Android OS. It has always worked well for me. I can't see the clues in night mode because the red letters are too blurry for my old eyes. But I don't really need night mode. Still I would love it if there is an option to increase the font size of the clues. Oh - I don't know why I have never been able to get any puzzle from the Washington Post. The NYT - LAT - Newsday - and Universal puzzles keep me plenty busy. I shouldn't really play more (chuckle!).,
Readability, The clue boxes are waaay too big. I can't see the whole word and it's beyond frustrating.,
Readability, App zooms all the way out from time to time - making it impossible to read - and can't be zoomed back in until the phone is restarted.,
Readability, Love the app - hate the new keyboard. It's more difficult to type and the screen is way too bright at night - even with my brightness at the lowest setting. Would be great without the bright white keyboard and floating letters.,
Readability,Night mode clues are very blurry. Night mode color needs a change option.,
Readability, While the new version is nice - I prefer the old version because it was a dark theme and the new one is white and bright which is a horrible battery drain and difficult to read because of the lack of contrast ... I also HATE the new keyboard! Give us the option of a dark mode and I'll up my rating.,
Readability, Could use a little more contrast (clues are hard to read) and a dark theme - but overall v4 gets a thumbs-up. Suggestion: puzzle size-based achievements.,
Readability, Great app - however the latest update has gotten a visual makeover that is bad. The keyboard is gone leaving floating letters and the light grey progress word under the clues is almost unreadable. Don't update if you have it installed.,
Readability, Do not like the new look!! Way too bright and contrasty keyboard hard to read and letters flicker when pushing directional buttons. Bring back the original!!!,
Readability, The boxes are much too big when scrolling through the clues. You can't see the size of the word without toggling to the entire puzzle or switching on the length option.  Please revert the size to the previous update!,
Readability,Loved this app until the last update. Play it daily. Now the clue boxes are huge and you can't see the whole word. Change it back please!,
Readability,Clue font size too small on Acer Chromebook. Settings feature to change the ,
Readability, Most of the puzzles I do are at night to wind down before I go to bed. I would love an option to invert the colors to make it easier on the eyes.,
Readability, The zoom feature doesn't work so well any more.  No matter what I try it will always return back to being fully zoomed out. So frustrating cuz now the text is to small to see.  Loved the app until the latest update - when the zooming issue began,
Readability, Why does this problem keep coming back?!   Every time I press a letter - the puzzle shrinks so small I can't read it.  5 stars when working - but only 1 when not.,
Readability,My only problem is the clue font size. Simply too small - and the size option disappeared after one of the updates. Good app.,
Readability, I now get the occasional zoom problem that others have described - where the puzzle shrinks to an unreadable size  whenever you enter a letter. I've found no alternative to uninstalling and reinstalling. It's such a wonderful app that it's worth doing this from time to time. But it would be so nice if it got fixed!,
Readability, Had the best interface compared to other crossword apps but since last update the clues are small and too hard to read. The clue for word you are working on is barely readable as the font is dark grey on light grey background. If clues were fixed would be five stars for sure!,
Readability, The white letters on the white keyboard are hard to see. I'm still addicted to the app - though. Trifocal Guy,
Readability, It's really hard to see the letters and box numbers with my old eyes!  Otherwise this is a fantastic app!,
Readability,I used to be able to manipulate the size of the clues - but now I can't find this feature. Please help - the small font is giving me a headache.,
Readability,could you please add font size option?,
Readability, It works as intended.  I would love to see the ability to change font size added in future versions.,
Readability,"Nice app but missing a high contrast theame option so can""t read text on some older devices.  As this affects the usability i have to take off one srar.",
Readability,Broadcast and Transcript titles are not visible when 'Force RTL Layout Direction' from Developer Options is turned ON.,
Readability, Excellent app iam happy using this app but please change the background color text unreadable in custom options.,
Readability, Great app for checking up on my RPi while on the go. I have just one problem with it - the free memory shown is not accurate in OpenElec - it only shows 30MB when there's over 500MB of free ram. Please fix this. A great addition would be to have the ability to change the font size - as it's too big for my taste. Thanks.,
Readability, Basic interpreter. Works well. Has several built in commands - but limited options for customization.,
Readability, Everything I hope for in an audio book player. Comes with folder filter - dark theme - custom album covers,
Readability,what happened. the lastupdate is the worst - i cant even see all books i can listen to - i see just those which i ended and those that i dindt.. i hate this. its inposible to navigaye through book + realu hard to see how much i listened. how can i go back on older versions?,
Readability,This app is great - the features make reading so much easier: night mode - access to the explain wiki - and even saving your spot after reading the latest make this the best app you can get.,
Readability, Apparently all kinds of other clients use HTML-like tags in messages for fonts - line breaks and so on. Those tags are displayed in this app as they are - so some messages are barely readable. If this gets fixed - five stars.,
Readability, Almost better to use the website - very limited features. Would like to be able to change font settings!,
Readability,Now - I can do most of my wallabag reading on my Android. I especially like two new features: dark mode (easier on the eye) The other is sharing to Wallabag is much better now. I don't have to jump to the browser. That was a big problem is earlier version. A new great feature is text-to-speech. It's awesome.,
Readability, I can finally bag pages through the share menu. The new app works great. I really appreciate the dark mode.,
Readability,It's white over white in the new version. Unreadable.,
Readability,Love the app and it's incredibly easy to use. Would love to have a way to change the text font size in an update though.,
Readability, Letters are not legible at all with GB :(,
Readability,Simply the best HN reader app out there. Lots of options and customizations - simple and clear UI - account handling and a lot more. Kudos to the devs behind it!,
Readability,Dark theme would be nice - but very pleased to see the recent addition of in-app PDF support.  All in all - a great app.,
Readability, Great work but increase text size as in app control did not work on Dell Venue 3830.,
Readability,Love it - makes reading hn a pleasure. Im especially fond of the dark theme. The only problem I see is that sometimes collapsing threads doesn't work and you're left with a thread only half collapsed.,
Readability, This is a great little app and fantastic for speeding up my low memory device - now no longer clogged up with the dreaded official app. I love the idea of a dark theme for easing strain on the eyes. HOWEVER - black background with nearly white writing is still quite harsh. A very dark grey background with pale grey font and a teal blue for text that needs to stand out from the rest is by far the gentlest and most gentle to read. Possibility? ALSO - really wish scheduled posting worked. Nearly 5*,
Readability,A worthy successor to the aard dictionary not only use one line but if she was the space you can download dictionaries as well. I'm dyslexic and find definitions to be very useful when reading complex documents. It's only flaw and this is a big one is an over complicated way of making text Baker and if I know your own fonts display. If we could skip the CSS complexity and just show a menu increase the font size and trees a font of external memory this would be a 5,
Readability, THE best reddit app with constant updates. Side note: dark themed widget has dark text - can't read anything.,
Readability, On the tops of comments - usernames - points - minutes - Flair are condensed into the left corner of a lot comments when using the LARGER FONT making them IMPOSSIBLE to read. Most posts have that info all across the top of the comment - which is normal and readable but a lot are skewed. Also - maybe the Flair should be a different color than the post and the username - points - minutes differentiated from the comment body text some how. Thanks! Oh and there's no way to view sidebars?,
Readability,Near perfect reddit app. The bonus lies in the customization.,
Readability,Great app Reddit - smooth interface - less buggy than the official app - and customization is nice (backgrounds - fonts - colours),
Readability, Tried a lot of reddit apps but this one is by far the best. Lots of customization and smooth performance.,
Readability, Does just what I need. I would only like to be able to increase the font size.,
Readability, Aside from the flashing that occurs with the dark theme in the recent update - this is one of the best and most complete bible apps on the market. I highly recommend it.,
Readability, Hi Martin I am a junior hebrew student. Please allow font selection - as I find these modern hebrew script too difficult to read. SBL_Biblit is available from the SBL site. I also noticed that there were no vowel points in Aleppo and it should have. G.B.Y. Thanx David Williams,
Readability, I translate at my church regularly and this is a helpful too. Two suggestions. One I couldnt see an option to increase font size - two the namesmof the books in the index could be kept full - would help if names were given in full.,
Readability,My favorite Bible app for reading and study! So many great features set this one above the many other Bible apps. I never even use MySword for studying any more. I only wish that there was an easy way to copy multiple verses and that there was a setting that allowed you to change pushing the back button to go to the previous chapter instead of just the previous verse. Also verse-text-background color themes would be cool.,
Readability, The settings makes it easy to customize how to view or use the Bible . Night mode makes it easier to read. You can increase text size for your convenience. You can easily search verses by typing key words. And much more. Thanks and God bless you.,
Readability,Very good features. Many useful version. Offline Bible. Some links for download doesn't work. Can't change font size.,
Readability, Best free bible for Android! My only complaint is the ugly white bar on the side of the screen in night mode - remove that and it'll be perfect!,
Readability, I tried 3 other android irc clients before this one. This one may not be the most colorful or flashy - but it works much better than the rest and has a decent amount of customization. No complaints here.,
Readability,Update: (1/5) The latest update has killed the add button. I can no longer create new files. This great app isn't great if it can't handle the basic add new file functions. Original: (4/5 stars) This is a great editor - but it has some minor bugs/issues. Ex. in dark mode - in settings - the text is black and can't be read. Also - sometimes the app crashes when tapping settings.,
Readability, Yeah it reads cbr files but u cant zoom in and out by pinching. Better cbr readers out there.,
Readability,change language problme,
Readability, Some remaining fails on that 4 letter word. Train stops/stations are shown with unrelated icons at different zoom - one zoom level gets bus icon. At some zoom levels bus stops disappear behind supporting features such as bicycle racks and waste baskets. And when invoking address geo intent from phonebook - it toasts nothing found and doesn't even open (address tested is in built in address search!).  Getting better though now 4.5 stars.,
Readability, The contour lines are there but difficult to read on some devices. To be perfect - the plugin definitely needs to allow the user to set the thickness. Similarly to the text size in the main app.,
Readability,Great app - simple - does the job - no ads but missing dark mode and m3u ,
Readability,can't change font or pictures sz for senior easy read,
Readability, The tabs at the top are missing slightly so I cannot see what the tabs say. Apart from that it's good. Xperia Z phone.,
Readability, I just wish you could increase font size...,
Readability, Great widget - unfortunately always leaves room for multiple stocks - which means it takes up way too much space to just monitor a few. If you try to resize smaller - it becomes unreadable even though there is plenty of space. Needs an auto resizing function. Otherwise - I'd use.,
Readability, Seems tomwork ok for me. My only complaint isnthe font size is too small - even when inselect large font. Im using it on my samsung note tab 10.1 .  Too small for me actually use it - so im gonna keep searching.,
Readability, Shows my stock in small font without having to scroll through lots of pages. Perfect for what I need.,
Readability, Needs adjustable fonts! Hard to read!  Did I make my point?,
Readability, This is a great widget but really needs the ability to select larger fonts.,
Readability, 'None' background setting is now all white and non-readable.,
Readability, I like the small font - allows for many stocks to be displayed. I would like a 4 x 3 size with more stocks allowed to be shown.,
Readability, I'm playing Anchorhead and there are some books that won't display (the Frazer history - for example). I'm also running into a memory leak when the transcript reaches a certain size where the keyboard will start to severely lag. Restarting the game with a clear log fixes that. Any helps with the readable issue would be appreciated.,
Readability, I can't  change font color. Dark mode doesn't  work correct. Text is too dark no matter of bright level.,
Readability, Used to work perfectly. Now it's a mess. Screens unreadable due to all codes beng displayed.,
Readability, I can't change the font from script without it crashing and putting script back on.  What is this? Okay so I fixed the font but nothing ever stays were I put it. Font size keeps shrinking and brightness keeps going back to 2% - and now it crashes every 6 or 7 pages.  And it can't read aloud.  I've never had any of these problems before on my other phone.,
Readability,Recently installed on Nexus 7.  Virtually unreadable. Used to be good. Hopefully update will put things right.,
Readability, Cool Reader outshines the other readers I've tried on my Android phone. The customization possibilities make it easily adaptable for each person's needs.,
Readability, Please bring back old paper background. Eye strain too much after long period of reading. Other than that great reader. Just one final request add PDF support.,
Readability, Amazing customization options - every little detail you can manage. I tried at least 10+ reader apps untill I tried this one. Found it 2 or 3 years ago it was fantastic then - and has only gotten better. Great on phone and tablet alike. I recommend this app to anyone!,
Readability, Read aloud feature with volume and speed control is very helpful.,
Readability, This is the best epub reader when used in day mode. I have some epub books which would not work no matter what setting used - the font is dark on dark - impossible to read.,
Readability, All the features I could want. I like the ability to keep the main menu bar showing on the top. Saves me tapping all over the screen to find it. Got the page numbers  I always want - the title and author showing since sometimes I forget what book I'm reading and have to page out to find out.  Lots of customization. I really like the initial set up with the old paper and old book look. This is my favorite reader app. Keep up the good work. Thanks!!!,
Readability, Does its job perfectly. Add a book to the device - Cool Reader displays it. That's all that I need. There are enough options to allow a lot of personalization - but it doesn't sacrifice utility or ease of use to provide those options.,
Readability,Brighrness not adjustible after opened the reader. Too bright to read in the darkness.,
Readability,My favorite app for reading - very comfortable to use - a lot of flexibility - great customization on look and control. Revision: I recently bought some books from humblebundle - downloaded their epub formats. the app keeps all of the css format - including the fonts - although  in the setting i have set to keep the internal styles - but i have not selected the embedded fonts. Still i can't change the font of the book - and the spacing between lines is pretty odd (also not changable - from the app) I checked other apps - it seems they are working fine in this regard. not sure what is causing coolreader to do this.  Also the PC version of coolreader seems to be handling the fonts pretty well - unlike the android app.,
Readability, This has been a great reader - but it never saves the setting such as brightness and font size. Every time I leave the app and go back in it has reset back to original settings,
Readability, Works great! I love that I can read all my stories on it. Great customizations if font - background color - even the tap options. Also works great with IVONA text to speech. Only issue I've had is with it randomly switching from page view to scroll view - but that's very minor.,
Readability," I like the Text-to-Speech(TTS) functionality very well. If we enable ""Read Aloud"" option - the text will be read by highlighting sentence by sentence. Only problem is the transapernt TTS control panel hides some of the text while reading. One of these solutions need to be implemeted: 1. Whenever the new sentence hide in the panel - show new page from that sentence.. 2. Make TTS control panel vanish after some time 3. Keep the TTS control panel available always and show the book only in the rest of the area. If then - 5 star..",
Readability, Since the latest update I cannot get text colour to be anything other than black. E.g. in night mode with white text on a solid black background the book text renders as black (unreadable) - but the Author Name - Book Title - Page Number etc do render as white.   Otherwise excellent!  UPDATE: Problem only affected the book I was reading at time of update. All working fine now.,
Readability, I love this reader! The customization is great and the old paper BG adds so much to the mood!,
Readability,It was my favorite reading app on my old phone - but on this version the font setting won't stick so I have to keep changing the font size for every session. :/,
Readability,I can't find how to change footnote font size: the menu for footnotes doesn't seem to change it - it seems. But otherwise a great app.,
Readability, Best reader - I tried a number of them. Only issue is after I upgraded to HTC one - the font sizes got screwed up - the largest one is what use to be medium on my HTC raider... Could u fix that? I''ll donate more...,
Readability, best reader..nice and light..lots of customization,
Readability, So much customization and the best nightmode on any app I have - which is a must-have for reading apps. It allows me to read RTF docs without screwing them up - which is a huge plus. Keep up the good work!,
Readability, One of the best readers. Supports most ebook formats which other readers don't. Has a huge list of customizations and configurations. Needs a huge improvement on appearance tho - this one is not exactly easy on the eyes. Needs a library feature - just a list of few recently opened books is not helpful as you need to keep importing previous books. Needs more fonts !,
Readability, Great way of selecting words. So nice to find a reader that does what i ask - instead of what Google - Amazon etc want me to do. Easy to customise background - text size - user interface - the action of screen touches... Works well - reliably.,
Readability, A great epub reader with lots of options for customization. My only complaint is that there is only one voice for reading aloud. I would like to have several other voices to choose from. And ofcourse I wish the voice was more life like.,
Readability,Does not allow access to External SD Card in Lollipop.  Update: No External Card in Marshmallow ---However . . .  Great visual presentations - flexible choices - and good functionality makes a really good reader. I wish that RSS Readers had the same readability - not low contrast fonts!,
Readability, Great for reading and has many customization options. Wish they also add PDF support.,
Readability, Lots of useful functions like night mode(really easy on the eyes) & backlight brightness control by flicking on the edge of the screen! Download ColorDict & link to CoolReader so you can look up word meanings while reading. Been using this app for 3 years. Highly recommended! Great job app developer!,
Readability, Love this app but no matter what I do it won't save the font size between sessions. The font it defaults to is incredibly tiny -  almost unreadable. 5 stars once this is fixed.,
Readability, Not sure if it was my book file or this app. - but the book i was reading decided to stop working and never open again.  Anyway -  I like the night mode which makes reading easy on the eyes.,
Readability, Have used it for sometime now and I am very impressed easy interface and a nice backgrounds and fonts still by far the best of all the readers and now the problem with mobi and html have been resolved .very easy to use and the adaptive background removes the strain in night mode ..well done,
Readability,Reader does not remember my previous settings. I must reset settings like portrait mode - font size - night mode - etc. everytime I enter the app.,
Readability, This reader is free - supports a wide range of eBook formats and allows for customization of a lot more than just the font style and size. It has worked out amazingly for eBooks that were on my PC but not purchased via Google Play or the Kindle Store.,
Readability, All Chinese words become question marks...,
Readability,Missing the ability to invert colour of images in night mode so they aren't blindingly bright. otherwise the best epub reader available!,
Readability,Cool Reader allows more customizations than have ever seen in a ePub reader. Plus - it has a soothing background - parchment paper - that is much easier on the eyes than just a color would be. Finally - it has a scrolling mode that lets you go down through the book or document with out having to flip pages - which is ideal for one of my uses. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars - is that it changes bold to Comic Sans. I wish this were an option that could be disabled. It is harder to read.,
Readability, I am an ebook creator who is testing various eBook readers. This reader doesn't do its job well. 1) can't display font color - 2) can't adjust font size - 3) error render sentences contains Chinese and English. 4) can't display cover image. In short - can't display a simple epub format in proper.,
Readability, Best ebook reader for me....reads almost everything. Great customization options,
Readability, The customization options and intuitive navigation options make the Cool Reader app my preferred option for reading on an Android device.,
Readability,Best reader ever!!!! But can you please make the icon more cooler? And can you please include a library like the ones from UB reader?? Oh and being able to change the background color for home menu would make it more cooler than ever! Thanks :),
Readability,"Sometimes not reads and it takes time to fit on screen and page hangs without proper scaling. Pages does not fit on screen.	Except given problems - its ok. Try it.",
Readability, The best reader you can find for your e books with lots of customization.,
Readability, Option rich - faster than anything else - easier to use. I can set font size - color - background color - scroll mode - choose your background - every option I can think is needed is there.,
Readability," Great eReader - lots of customization - little bloat and has handled the diverse formats I've thrown at it so far.  I noticed that every once in a while (probably once or twice in the last year that I've used it) - it would ""forget"" where my progress was in some .txt files but the UI is friendly enough that I could find where I left off easily.",
Readability, I love this app! Everything is adjustable - font size - background - brightness. There are even little fields you can double program for what you want them to do (bookmark - forward/backward 1 or 10 pages - pp.) Sooo good! Ã¢Â˜Âº,
Readability, I love this reader but now I am having issues with the night mode text and I can't see it.  Instead of the yellow I am used to it is now grey and hard to read,
Readability,The best reader I've ever used. The customization abilities make this the only reader I'll ever use. It suits my the needs of my sight issues. The only drawback is the last update. It will not utilize the fonts that I've been using in the reader for years - that are comfortable for my eyes to read for extended periods of time. I've rolled back to the version previous this latest update - and will continue using it until this issue is fixed. It still works as I need it to.,
Readability,I use this a lot - for various ebook formats - often in night mode - which is great for reading without a lights on in the room. Updating my review - I used to like it better. One dubious change is that the convenient - old double tap - which on a cellphone could be done with your thumb - has changed to a clumsy two-finger tap - which requires your other hand to hold the phone.,
Readability, I love the night mode. I only wish it could read djvu,
Readability,A very intuitive UI design - but I'd like more days in portrait view and also font size settings.,
Readability,It would be better - if there is an option to increase the text size in the starting screen. Very small font in used by default.,
Readability,Grey background and very light font makes it difficult to read. Night screen doesnt help. Would benefit from prof readability design.,
Readability,Can you add font size?,
Readability,Good app. Had installed for about a year - most apps i tend to try but uninstall for various reasons. This app is a keeper. Pros: - Night mode - Free - Tracking history easy to view - Multiple tasks can be tracked at a time - I had about 10 at one stage - not all were daily tasks. - Easy to use - Option for single tap check/uncheck task complete. (quick updating user input - - handy with lots of concurrent tasks) Cons: - No real cons. Please don't break app with an update. Thank you for you work.,
Readability,Really simple and intuitive habit tracking list! Does exactly what it sets out to do and its free. The only change i'd like to see is an option for better contrasting check marks when using the pure black setting.,
Readability,Simple to use - basic habbit app. Love how you can track the stats for your habbits and how if you forgot to mark off yesterdays habbit you can fix it easily.  Would like to see automatic update when used on multiple devices - the ability to group tasks under headings (ie health goals - work goals etc) and to customise the tick (ie instead of a tick you could use a star - a smiley face a thumbs up ect),
Readability,It will be greater if it have font size control...this is a must for such type of apps,
Readability,In night mode it's hard to read blue font,
Readability, Pros: - full Wikipedia offline. - most functions work well. Cons: Night mode doesn't work. There is no text-re-flow for easier reading.  I think over all it does the job - but compared to applications that do the same thing on the iPhone it's just okay.,
Readability,Offline Wikipedia - great for when there's no Internet connection. There are ,
Readability, Very useful app. Only one bug - the app doesn't remember font size changing in setting please fix that.,
Readability,This app is very useful for survival situations. The layout is simple and the information is easily accessible.,
Readability,Have been using this app for over a year. Never failed to help me analyze perfect gameplay and with ease. I really love how consistently this app develops as soon as a new version of stockfish comes out - also there's a ton of adjustable preferences which I love. Thanks for developing this app :),
Readability,I cannot Understand what happens. Anytime I download and Redownload the chess peices are showing in Letters and not how they are supposed to be. I see rows of M - P - and soo much more Black Letters Overlapping white ones. Edit: It Works!!! Thank you soo much,
Readability,Difficult to select Ctrl and another key. No delete right key on main keyboard.  Difficult to read shifted chars on keys (too dark). Superfluous circle key. Poor documentation (have to use horrendous Github).,
Readability,I LOVE the (experimental) transparency theme! It would be even better with customizable opacity and colors - to make the area behind the keys more readable. This keyboard is a great companion to my Swype keyboard when I want to input somethimg more precise or technical.,
Readability, Good idea the transfer on screen of the pc kb - keeping a low profile on customisation (basic functions and nothing more)_ a remark: the secondary characters on keys should be bigger & colored as the main ones to be more readable. Performances in plain pc style.,
Readability, Can you make the font size bigger or put an option to make the fonts bigger? Thanks in advance. Nice keyboard by the way  -),
Readability, It's hard to see which ones I have read. Please consider a strike through to indicate it's been seen,
Readability, Only 2 issues I have - which are more so Suggestions. First - I like nightmode because I prefer my text I'm reading to have a black background. I do enjoy the overall darker theme too. However it would be nice to add some color in there. Maybe have an option to change the background color between the standard white or black and then be able to apply your themes on top of that. Second would be the ability to up vote/down vote comments by swiping left or right like I can do the posts! Thanks for the great app!,
Readability, Really liking your take on a reddit client though simple things like a bit more polish and font sizes would make this even better. Good job,
Readability,VERY impressed. In a crowded field - this app gets a lot of things right - including the all important font customization. Very nice.,
Readability, Cant read/load simple icons on subreddits.. useless and unreadable.,
Readability,The app and its features are great. The thing I'd definitely change are its color combinations extremely hard to read - specially if users have color blindness (O tested that with a daltonic user - huge nightmare!) Another thing: where to help on translating the app to Spanish and French ?,
Readability, I needed a way to read at night without disturbing my wife. I tried a few apps - but this one got me what I sought and does it easily.,
Readability,GREAT reader - and open-source too! As I promised - I give stars back for ,
Readability, It is not working when i want to open my file and it can't read hindi language,
Readability, Creating tasks easy and fast - getting rid off isn't. Perfect. Super dark theme  - very readable. Awesome for left hand use. Auto sync works perfectly. Great job...,
Readability, There is a little overlay with some of the writing (letters overlap each other)  But still totally usable. Thanks,
Readability,One gripe: dark ui theme unuseable because of white text on bright green header - unreadable.,
Readability, Did not work for me. When setting up Deluge server - it automatically appends 8112 as default port and there's no way to change it. This is pretty basic customization which should have been there. Not everybody uses the default ports.,
Readability,It's awesome and I love the fact that it automatically goes to night mode whenever it's in the evening and also the manual subtitle download is great -the exact subtitles,
Readability,"It's perfect. I even use it on my PC as my primary video player when watching anime. Though there is one problem I'm experiencing with VLC Android and that is the subtitles. Some subtitles become unreadable especially if the text is decorated by many colors - strokes - motions - etc. This happens when the ""OpenGL ES2 usage"" option is set to Automatic or Force Off. Everything is fine when set to Force On.",
Readability,The night reading mode has changed from having a black screen to a light ,
Readability,Wikipedia gone native. Very smooth experience - good night mode - tabbed reading is very convenient.,
Readability,Excellent app - well designed and fantastic source of information. Easy to use - friendly design - includes dark mode.,
Readability,I cannot see any text in latin while using Wikipedia in Serbian. Please fix ,
Readability,It is awesome - useful - informative - and easy to use but it would be more Awesome if you add Dark Theme...,
Readability,Dark theme is messed up - everything looks white. It's unreadable.,
Readability,charts overlapping with text -- unreadable,
Readability,I love this app - but since the update - the dark themes are completely unusable. I can only read things in the white theme and I like to read as I fall asleep. Sadly I'm going to have to find an alternative Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â©,
Readability,Text gets white background in dark mode. Can't read anything properly. Please fix this,
Readability,"Articles are frequently unreadable - due to the ""About this article"" and ""read more"" sections overlapping and cutting off the bottom of the page.",
Readability,because there is no brightness and volume buttons directly for mobile,
Readability, This is a very pretty looking app I really wish like the old XBMC remote there was a large pause button in the middle,
Readability,Basically a clone of the AOSP keyboard. Would be nice if you could enter a hex value of the background color instead of these unprecise sliders.,
Readability,I love this very simple keyboard.. The size is very tiny and but has fast response. The customization setting is straight forward. I am using it mostly for working and messaging and it wroks very well and FAST. Love it love it.. A very rare gem... Thanks to the developer (I would like to give him a thumb up but this kb has no emoji  --),
Readability,great app. please add TextSize variable. unreadable on large screens...,
Readability,The bigger text skin is my favorite except it lacks the option to change the background color.,
Readability, Noticed too small font,
Readability,Left/right margins are absent. 4-6% would be near to optimal. Aligning to page width is antihuman:) Standard aligning to left is the most readable. And the stopper: it is impossible to turn off the app as URL handler. That is - say - Firefox shows additional Android icon instead of only listing the app in  share list. Screenshot is sent to 4PDA.,
Readability,It's good but I cannot read text on Black background on widget. Please fix ,
Readability,It's been giving me reminders even though I told it not to - may be a problem with syncing to Google calendar. Having two events at the same time makes the calendar unreadable due to poor resizing.,
Readability, Absolutely good for reading - but weaknesses in zooming,
Readability, Modulus(absolute value) function missing.  Graphs can't be zoomed in or out properly.  Can't find single given value on graph.  Tedious calculations give stack errors.  Imaginary representation not possible. Also you have removed matrix calculator.  Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â¢Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â¢Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â³Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â³ Rest is fine to me,
Readability, It seems like the old graphing system was better. The numbers get really odd when zoomed in. Negative goes on the right and positive goes on the left...? Doesn't make sense.   Also - the Android wear app is laggy and it doesn't have any trig functions (sin - cos - tan)!,
Readability, Excellent! Simple - fast - uncluttered - easy to navigate. Searchable list of elements - zoomable table view - lots of data and wikipedia links for more.,
Readability, I was reading the comments on this game. I just want to ask what all you people are smoking. This game is horrible.. For one how the heck are people suppose to find the quest locations of there is no assistance. I'm where to go or Who to talk to its ridiculously horribly setup.,
Readability, I downloaded several - and I keep returning to this one. Easy to use -  minimalist - and reliable. Love that there is independent volume control...,
Readability, Love the customization and cleanliness of the app. Only irritation is the return bar is default a smiley keyboard - not a return bar but that is easily fixed by going to settings.,
Readability, Oncely in the past/former releases this app was promising a lot comprehensive features and reliability si I bought it with all extra parts as I intensively use it for much more than simple map. It an even integrate video notes with locations within the most comprehensive maps I have ever seen. I like at most its integration with updated local transportation. However POI names have fixed  unreadable low size that can not be resized or zoomed with the map but hoping it will be fixed in next release...,
Readability, First impression: a messy program. not intuitive - way too many settings (you don't want to have to set things up differntly for each book - do you?) with black theme (hey - 2 or 3 themes is really sufficient) - text becomes invisible. Readers don't want to know about CSS - do they ? How about EPUB3? In short: I want to READ a book - not make one. A reader should be EASY... like a book.,
Readability,Very handy! More useful on CyanogenMod which has a larger font database.,
Readability, The shift and control key functions are highly useful. Wish there could be more themes - Chinese input and perhaps swiping input. Thanks! Well done!,
Readability, I'm amazed by the amount of options this keyboard has - ranging from font sizes - different key ranges etc. 10/10 - would install again.,
Readability,simple with easy navigation and readable context.,
Readability,The voice keeps breaking so u can't actually understand it,
Readability,Nice app but her presentation is not clear And not clear voice,
Screen Size,"I cant uploading my video, fix it asap, this aplication is terible??",
Screen Size,"Make Subtitle available, please.. I cant even hear a word they said..",
Screen Size,Minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing UI. Very customizable with an ,
Screen Size,Think I found a bug: for some reason - bookmark list takes only half of the screen - showing a webpage view on the right hand side. Perhaps this was intended - but without being able to zoom/swipe to either of them - the list becomes unusable :(,
Screen Size,This is the very first time in my life that I'm paying for an app! I have just 3 suggestions - Can you please add an option to lock zoomed-in view so that I'm not sent to the next picture when swiping/panning around the zoomed-in picture? ALSO - when viewing pictures (full screen view) - I really think a smaller text size for the file names will better. Lastly - refresh rate of the app is really not up to par with the competition.,
Screen Size,zoom feature needs to be fixed. Laggy,
Screen Size,Great app! Thumbs up for 1:1 zoom.,
Screen Size,Incredible app .. allows me to run all my essential linux console programs on my tablet or phone - with or without external bluetooth keyboard.  Eg: Emacs/tramp editing over VPN - full access/editing of my encrypted org-mode files (synced with dropbox/dropsync) - monitoring phone's resources with htop. And - if I'm at someone else's computer and need access to my stuff - I can just ssh into my phone and enjoy the convenience of big screen/keyboard/mouse with my portable server! :-)  Yeah - it's slower than a desktop - but surprisingly usable.  Before this - I had thought seriously about loading ubuntu onto my tablet to get this type of portable linux environment - but honestly - termux gives me pretty much everything I need (console-based for now) - plus android .. best of both worlds!  Just when I'm already blown away - I find other really stuff in the well-written docs: multiple-sessions - keyboard enhancements (such as: press volume down to simulator ctrl) -  termux-api (send/read SMS - text-to-speech etc.) ... just incredible.   Great community and support too.  Keep up the awesome work Fredrik - thank you.,
Screen Size, I left a very silly review about size. I use my tablet like a laptop. Pinch to zoom I failed to do. RTFM'ed - I later did.,
Screen Size,Very slow unfortunately. Can't zoom out to see the entire code,
Screen Size, Unfortunately this app has become unusable recently due to an issue with the zoom function.  It will not stay zoomed in when working on a puzzle. Moving the cursor will reset the zoom - making the text too small. Please fix the zoom!,
Screen Size,This is the best crossword app - but trying to zoom in and out is a nightmare. The pinch zoom rarely works and the preset sizes are so weird. I wish I could lock it into the size I like and have it never zoom in/out on accident or when the app updates.,
Screen Size, Puzzles randomly zoomed way out and I tried everything to zoom back in - but to no avail. This made the app literally unplayable. If this were fixed though - this would be a great app.,
Screen Size, Almost unusable for Samsung GS3. Touching the screen to enter a letter makes the puzzle zoom out so you can't read the puzzle. I use this daily and now I'm sad...,
Screen Size, Default zoom and 'zoom reset' are only 8 cells wide on my phone.  Zooming out only gets to 10 cells wide before hitting the limit.,
Screen Size, I have reset the zoom several times - but everytime I touch the screen to add my word it goes back to the smallest screen on the top left side. Love the puzzles but your settings are a problem.,
Screen Size, I loved this app on my old phone but it is unusable on my Galaxy S4. The puzzle size is too tiny to be playable and it will not zoom in at all. :-( Please please fix it...,
Screen Size, App work fine for several uses on my Photon Q. Now the puzzle is tiny- cant get the zoom function to work or figure out other ways to solve the issue. It's not worth playing until this is fixed. Just a guess but it's probably the slide-out keyboard that's the issue. Devs may want to start looking there. Other than that - it's a decent app- free crosswords (though the first one I started didnt have the solution).,
Screen Size, Puzzles do not fit to screen properly on my Galaxy S6.  Bottom row or bottom two rows never show on fit to screen mode.  I always have to pick zoom out.  Also -  wrong letters no longer show as red unless that word/clue is selected.  If not on the clue with the error it just shows an opaque pink box.  Please fix these two things.  Have had this game for years and love it.  Would also love to see it on the app store for my iPad.,
Screen Size, Constantly zooms to smallest screen with every tap on my Samsung Galaxy S2.  Can only be reset by restarting phone.  Causes phone to freeze.  Uninstalled.,
Screen Size, Cannot zoom out on these huge boxes.  App has tons of extra files to download.,
Screen Size," Newest version had zoom issues on Sunday Puzzles on Dell Venue 8. Full puzzle won't display and needs to scroll vertically about 3 boxes. Otherwise - just needs to display the ""crossed"" clue automatically to be perfect.",
Screen Size, It was working fine till one day the puzzle would shrink - and I'd zoom it out - and I'd go to touch the screen to start the puzzle again - it shrinks again.  Or - I go onto another one and it won't zoom at all.  What gives?  I'll install/uninstall once.  Otherwise if it doesn't work I'll try something else..pity - I liked this too.,
Screen Size, Loved this app - but now the puzzles are constantly zooming out. Fix this asap please!!,
Screen Size, This was my absolute favorite app until the last update. The zoom function is all over the place and most of the settings don't work. The dates are all wrong in on the download screen (for example - today would say Friday the 17th - when it is actually the 18th) and most of the weekend - large-format puzzles (which I prefer) are not downloading. Hoping for a fix soon!!!!,
Screen Size,Almost unusable on a tablet. Zoom does not work it stays at small size -until it is fixed I will have a hard time enjoying it Does not save any puzzle I am working on. It goes back to an empty puzzle,
Screen Size, The app works great on my Galaxy S5 Sport but on my Galaxy Tab S the screen response is a bit laggy and it doesn't zoom to fit screen in tablet landscape mode.,
Screen Size, App has been great - but in update 4.3.5 - full screen on my tablet no longer works. Zoom only gets about 1/2 full screen.,
Screen Size, great app but there's some issue with the zoom.  can't touch the puzzle to move from clue to clue - it just keeps making the puzzle incredibly small.    app needs an update. like for real.,
Screen Size, Of course - every app has its faults... as does this one. But the little things - such as the zooming in of the screen - can be overlooked. The main issur I've had with this app is the zoom - and size of the board. If you accidentally zoom in on the board it can be a bit difficult to get it back to the default size. But thats my only real complaint! Otherwise - I  love it!,
Screen Size,Current version (as of this review) is unusable on my phone.  For some reason - when switching to Clues mode - it zooms the entry boxes until they're huge and I can only see 4 on screen at a time.  I can zoom out - but as soon as I move to a new clue it zooms back in like this.  None of the zoom settings affect the zoom of the clues mode.  Meanwhile - I can't work in puzzle view because my screen is too small.  This all seems to work fine if you have a tablet - and it used to be my favorite game on my phone (when I could see 8-10 letters on the clue screen) - but it's just unusable on a small screen now.  FWIW - I really appreciate the author's work.  Like I said - I used to love this program.  I think it just hasn't been getting tested on smaller screen phones lately...,
Screen Size, This was my favorite app until it broke. Clicking anywhere just zooms out so I cant see anything now.,
Screen Size, This used to be my favorite app until the last update. Now any time I click to begin answering a clue it zooms out so small it can't be played. Please fix - uninstalling until then,
Screen Size, Zoom issues just make it frustrating. It used to be great...but suddenly every time I touch the screen it zooms to unusable tiny size. Please fix! Then 5 stars.,
Screen Size, Zoom does not work properly and i can't move it when it is zoomed in. Sometimes the titles are messed up showing symbols instead of letters. Also the puzzle randomly becomes slanted and unresponsive.,
Screen Size, I love the main app but am currently frustrated by the zoom issue.  Didn't have spam issues as one reviewer reported.  Just a great variety of puzzles each day.  Please fix zoom.,
Screen Size, Zoom issues have been going on for a while now. I don't want to give up on the app but I'm getting very annoyed by the shrinking screen in the middle of my game!,
Screen Size, Great app - rendered useless at times due to the view getting skewed. Please fix! This app will be 5 stars all day long once this is fixed.,
Screen Size, The zoom gets stuck and the puzzle becomes too small to see!,
Screen Size, Please fix the zoom issues. Other than that - great app.,
Screen Size, Used to love this app but the zoom issues are killing me! Please fix!!!!!,
Screen Size, On ICS SGS II - cannot zoom in - almost unplayable on landscape orientation..,
Screen Size, Great app until the puzzles started zooming out at any tap of the screen - and no matter how much I mess with the settings I can't fix it. So frustrating - awesome crossword app otherwise.,
Screen Size, Can you do something about scaling your views correctly for a tablet? I get micro fonts - and check boxes I can't set. Can't use the config screen. Can't do anything...very frustrating. One star for encouragement...,
Screen Size, Cannot open a reÃ‘Âent database if root access is required. Settings are inacÃ‘Âessible inside DB view so you need to close DB to change font or page size.,
Screen Size,Awesome app. Only problem is new update doesn't allow zooming into article in browser. Otherwise this app is perfect,
Screen Size,Can't zoom. Page doesn't fit in reader. Glitchy side scrolling. Altogether - ,
Screen Size, I've tried well over a dozen Bible apps and none are as polished as this one. Fortunately you can adjust the look and style. Tinker with it and you will find the style you love (I use one verse per line - night theme - slightly larger than default text size). The double tap to go full screen feature is cool. Also - free Bible versions downloads are a huge plus! Is there a way to donate via Google Play like a 'pro donate version'?,
Screen Size," Please add pinch zoom as not all language has same readability at same pixel size.  Please use full names instead of 3-4 char short hand for book names in ""choose book"". Screen will not fit all books this way but can be solved by using scroll up down or swipe between NT & OT screens.",
Screen Size, This app. leads the way for me thus far - I greatly admire the thoughts of the one who has made it as comfortable as it is. I installed more than one for purpose of choice  - the one con I find with this - is with the swiping from one chapter to the next - its not working I have to go back to passage. To know that the text size can be changed - great settings be bless -be blessed in Jesus .  I have the Samsung Galaxy Note  Much Thanks - Bro. Kinch,
Screen Size, It's ok does not zoom on my galaxy S 4 makes it really hard to read need a magnifying glass to read comic  - make it zoom and I will give it 4 stars...,
Screen Size, fast - simple and elegant! just wish for orientation control and zoom feature when fit to width. kudos.,
Screen Size, Certainly - given its small size and ease of use i must say its one of the most bestest apps out there and i will surely give it a five star rating if u add a pinch zoom feature in it! Thanx!,
Screen Size, My only complaint is its lack of pinch zooming. Other than that - it's fantastic,
Screen Size, Yeah right. Try better next time. You can't  even  zoom. Completely  rubbish,
Screen Size, Why can't you zoom in - some text can hardly be seen and its worse on a duble page. It's the only problem I have come across but its kinda a biggie As it means having to read those pages on another comic reader that can zoom but crashes every other page.,
Screen Size, What app doesn't allow you to zoom in?,
Screen Size, No manual zoom whatsoever.... useless on my cell phone.,
Screen Size, Can't (pinch) scale pages while reading - making this app useless.,
Screen Size, Works well and is FOSS - has enormous potential.  All it needs is pinch zoom for smaller screens and it would be the best cbz app on Android. Also please add page tapping left or right of the screen to turn pages.  It is a shame that other cbz/cbr apps are closed source bloatware. GPLv3 ensures you know what you are getting.,
Screen Size,Love Muzei but I can't use it anymore. MOST paintings are NOT PROPERLY CROPPED. They have white edges on top and bottom which makes the wallpaper look unappealing. Either give us an option to zoom into the painting a bit and keep it that way or just recrop the bunch. Forces me to get rid of the wallpaper every time.,
Screen Size,Good but not quite there yet. We can't select our era or theme preferences e.g. Chinese or Asian modernist or traditional paintings - artist - impressionist era or the Renoir era etc. So we are at the mercy of Muzei to select a good painting suitable for backgrounds and lockscreens. Of course -the range of selections should not be too much - otherwise it gives one a headache.,
Screen Size, Great app - but zooms in on 1080x1920 wallpapers when set on Xperia Z3. Kind of weird,
Screen Size,Missing zoom around the tap point. Otherwise a good app. I use it a lot.,
Screen Size, Keeps randomly crashing on my HTC one x and putting me back several pages. True full screen and the ability to dim the devices control keys would be good too. But I do recommend - despite the issue above still best reader out there - sort the crashing out and 5* for sure.,
Screen Size,Promising!  I've been a very happy Libre Office (Windows PC) for several years. Whilst I would have little use for a full version on my Android phone (an ageing S3) - a simple viewer is very handy. I've only used this development version to view some simple Calc sheets - but aside from some minor graphical artefacts (easily resolved by zooming-in - then out or vice-versa) - it worked well. I hope the developers will continue this project - I would certainly appreciate it!,
Screen Size,It's fairly usable. My 3 main issues are being unable to zoom in on sheets on my phone and the application crashing a lot and the hardware keyboard not working on a Chromebook.,
Screen Size,Having no zoom capability makes viewing even a simple spreadsheet difficult and a large one impossible. This needs work - but I don't think anyone is listening.,
Screen Size,The app is excelent but need a zoom that fit always the page width.,
Screen Size, Excellent app for the price (free). It would be perfect - if the options in the Settings section actually work: Zoom levels of small - medium of large display the same font size. Choosing night mode doesn't reverse colours. Zoom option just expands the text - doesn't reflow text (wrap) into the screen space - hence necessitating lateral scrolls. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with stock ROM.,
Screen Size, UI is slow and completely useless in portrait mode because the menu on the bottom covers more than half the screen (yes - some people have hardware keyboards). I cannot download pictures - I cannot see my text in the chat and I get multiple notification sounds. Video also doesn't work for me.,
Screen Size, When you zoom in about half the tiles fail to load - so you end up with a mismatch of various zoom levels tiles.,
Screen Size, App works good REALLY NEEDS ARROW KEYS once it has those ill 5star it. Also UI customization besides just the language would be nice especially key size ( not just the board) but its functional.,
Screen Size,good but need zoom out,
Screen Size,One star for being small - one for being ad free - one for night mode and bonus two.,
Screen Size, To the developer who made this browser - thank you so much - it's all I could ever ask for. Fast - simple - clean - and the ad block is awesome - no more accidentally tapping them. I only have one problem. When I watch a video in full screen mode I can't control anything like pause - play - volume - etc. I saw that the most recent update was supposed to fix the issue - but the problem still persists for me.,
Screen Size,It would be awesome if custom mages aren't zoomed in,
Screen Size,the subtitles get cropped too when using zoomed in mode in 21:9 displays. fix it please,
Screen Size,Subtitles doesn't work on casting.,
Screen Size,It's can't cast subtitles to chromecast,
Screen Size,Edit: Problem solved! Everything is great till I found there is no pinch to zoom option! Nowadays every phone has 18:9 aspect!,
Screen Size,Nice simple clean remote. Only gripe is the interface doesn't fit itself to smaller screens. On my 5.5 inch screen phone the remote fits perfectly - but on an older 4 inch screen phone i use as a remote the image of what your watching can be a bit to large and either overlaps the controls or pushes the controls off rhe bottom of the screen. Other than that 5 stars.,
Screen Size, Any way a full screen toggle for the android app could be added?  I don't need to see my notification bar all the time. The ability to control Kodi's volume on any screen within the app would be nice too. Those are basically my only gripes.,
Screen Size," Still some wrinkles - zoom 1km is too big as a minimum for pg.    When we get 7"" tablet with gps and USB on the go with a proper sunlight readable display (pixel qi) then XCsoar can rule the world.    This hardware is not that far away...",
Screen Size,"This is the best Android browser I've ever used. It is extremely light and fast (even on my Galaxy smartphone from 2011) - bookmarks are so easy to reach and it looks really functional and minimal with its great fullscreen mode and black AMOLED theme. My favourite feature is the ""Inverted Grayscale"" rendering mode- it transforms my AMOLED smartphone to an e-book reader saving battery. Then there is an option to block ads - set any user agent - activate text reflow and change the text size of any web page. I really can't believe all these features are able to fit in only 2MB (Chrome was taking more than 100MB on my phone - bloating more and more and being incredibly slow to start and browse on my Galaxy S II). I'm happy to recommend this browser to anyone.",
Screen Size, View - open - edit - create - save any document either from Microsoft office formats and OpenOffice formats and PDFs also. Exactly what I was looking for - lightweight app for viewing and editing OpenDocuments. It takes 5 -3 MB of storage - fantastic. I have downloaded AndrOpen Office before - it was big (cca 50MB) and it was no good for my phone (4'') - it didn't fit on screen and it wasn't well optimalized for  android (interface almost like PC version and zooming was wierd),
Screen Size, Shame there is not any scale to fullscreen options. Instead you have to manually zoom in. But otherwise is superior to other free vncs.,
Screen Size," I like this app and I really do want to stick with it (it's a toss between this and slim social) but not having the option to change font size as I can in slimsocial may be the deal breaker. It is smoother than slimsocial on my phone but the default font size is simply too small on an average smart phone... Unless I'm missing an option somewhere - in which case I'd appreciate advice!?! Also - scheduled posting in managed community pages doesn't work - ""post"" button is non-responsive!",
Screen Size, It works flawlessly - it needs only black theme for amoled screens.,
Screen Size," Have not had a chance to try it out really yet. Had some problems that turned out to be due to font size. The default ""auto"" pushed things off the screen and could not scroll to them. On the plus side I was contacted quickly by the dev. and the fix was simply to change the size to normal - small - or very small.  Unlike some games where I was ignored or told to log into the game to report a problem and then ignored.",
Screen Size,Unplayable. Doesn't scale to tablets - can't see anything going on - just really bad.,
Screen Size, Only issue I have is the graphics are very small - kind of hard to see. Still looks promising.,
Screen Size, Would be great to see night mode (with deep black background) and full screen,
Screen Size,So far love it!  Fits onto my compact screen (mere 4.6in) with ease.  No excess clutter with countless links to emojis - videos - etc.  You can even disable the avatars for less clutter.  Love the color and notification customization. This is the simplicity I've been searching for!,
Screen Size, I am really enjoying just about everything with this app. It's quick - the heads up notifications work really well and the lot. But there are a couple big issues for me: 1) Auto night mode is not consistent - and the text does not change to a contrasting color without backing out of or force restarting the app. 2) MMS works well - for receiving messages - but they are displayed as this ludicrously small slide show at the top of the screen. Why can't I look at each image individually and zoom?,
Screen Size, Tried all of these so called replacements. If they cannot provide a simple mobilized version of the FULL story to fit onto the screen with adjustable text size - then they all get a fail from me. Mobile devices require this as an essential if not primary feature. gReader works well for me and are standing by their product after Google terminates.,
Screen Size,Seems a bit slow. At 5 MB it's twice the size of some similar apps. I like the night mode option.,
Screen Size, Simple no nonsense note taking app. Some work could be done on the gui - like fonts overlapping the bounding box for example. Also would love to see a dark transparent widget!,
Screen Size, The new tablet update looks great on my Touchpad and is lightweight and functional on both my phone and tablet.   Scrolling is even fixed! And the most recent updates include my number one wanted features - sync and the ability to change your font size!  This app is great.,
Screen Size,Lovely but I'd like a night mode for oled screens.,
Screen Size,Works great on lg g3. Managed to capture very old handwritten papers with clarity once i had got as much light as possible and a contrasting background.,
Screen Size, The zoom feature is the only downside to this app. It really needs to be fixed. Constantly zooms out so you are unable to see the letters you have typed in. Very annoying. Love the app but I cannot deal with this. Moving on to another one.,
Screen Size, It has a great selection of puzzles and I like how it updates daily. However - you can't see the entire puzzle at once and instead have the keyboard taking up half the screen. It should work more like words with friends - where you can zoom in on a section of the board or view the entire board at once. The keyboard should hide while you view the whole puzzle - and then pop up when you want to type.,
Screen Size, Love the puzzles.  However always zoomed out makes it too hard too see clues and letters.  Also orientation will not fix at portrait.,
Screen Size, Love this app and have it installed on my Atrix 2 phone as well as my Nexus 7 tab.  The puzzles are great and the app itself is pretty no nonsense.  My only quibble (and the only reason I gave it four stars) is due to the constant flickering I experience when playing on the tablet version.  It sadly makes the game unplayable.  Thank goodness my phone version works perfectly!,
Screen Size, Great for number of puzzles - but the puzzle would zoom out whenever i rotated the screen. After a while it would zoom out whenever i touched the puzzle.  I tried to set the default to screen width but it dint work. The doomed out puzzle is too small to see - so i just deleted the app.,
Screen Size, Love the app but the zooming issues are horrible! All of a sudden my crossword is so small I can't see anything and I can't get it to zoom in. Please fix!,
Screen Size, Since the new update when I tap on a clue the puzzle gets small and when choose to fit to screen it won't stay. I can't do the puzzle if I can't see it.,
Screen Size, Fonts are sooo small on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet. I can read the fonts if I have the tablet pretty close - but it makes enjoying the game with the family a challenge.  We absolutely love this app and use it daily.,
Screen Size, I would like this app if the grid didn't keep shrinking in the middle of completing puzzles. The grid keeps shrinking so small that I can't read it and the only way to get the grid back to full screen is to uninstall and reinstall the app until it happens again...I have uninstalled for good now,
Screen Size,I love this app! Thank you. Please use a larger font size for the clues.,
Screen Size, What's with the zoom issue all of a sudden?  The app was awesome but suddenly I can't make the puzzle stay full screen for anything. I can't stand trying to play on a puzzle that isn't even a quarter of the size of my phone screen. Please fix this!,
Screen Size, I love this app. My only issue is the zoom problem. Otherwise - great for puzzlers of all different levels,
Screen Size, But many features you need to add. Like Folders - Sorting option - font size - font colour - check list - themes - PIN protection etc. And another all full note showing in full screen mode.,
Screen Size, I tried using this app because it takes up so little space - but I didn't get very far before the way the screen flickers whenever you slide a number totally got on my nerves. It's nothing like the smooth animation in my other version. I appreciate how little room it takes up on my phone - but I'm not sure it's worth it.,
Screen Size,Good software - my suggestions - skin option to small screens - option to see ,
Screen Size,The application works as advertised.  Comes in very handy when optimizing your WiFi network. However I would suggest a few improvements: - The application icon can be difficult to see depending on your screen background.  Maybe add a background to the icon rather than making it transparent? - Increase the font size in the graphs legend - it was hard to read the text on my phone (Nexus 5). - Make it easier to match the graphs legend to the actual series displayed in the graphs.,
Screen Size, Like the search and dark theme options - just needs optimizations for landscape view.,
Screen Size,Would be even better with a completely black theme - for oled screens.,
Screen Size,I love this app! I have looked through so many solitaire games to find the right one and this is it. I only wish it had a size feature because the cards can be a bit hard to see when playing portrait style.,
Screen Size, Executes my legacy SQLite queries. Export to CSV is good - but does not export field names (heard that donate version does) -  does surround text with quotes making data easier to import to other applications. Font size - saving queries etc... all in Options. Would be good to be able to choose light/dark display. Good response from developer.,
Screen Size, Great app. Type font is too small to read on Nexus7 tablet as default. Please update to sense screen size automatically and use appropriate font size. Other than that - it has a very good intuitive interface. I set the font size to 18 in setup and it's good now.,
Screen Size, Need some additions -   - adjustable font size   - a separate application to go directly to my favorite views and data entry   - a way to define a data entry screen  As the application is - I find it extremely useful as sortable - filterable list of short notes - like reminders - shopping lists.  To make it end user frienly - it need data entry screen with some drop down lists (eg. select enty from a short table) - buttons and direct access to query screen with (or  without) search entry.,
Screen Size,I was fine at first then i don't know why my screen will zoom in and I cant see some notes and I can't even tap it - after I reinstall back is still the same,
Screen Size,First of all I love this game very much but there's a bug in my device and I can't play normally because of that issue. The sliders and circles seems to be overlapping my screen resolution whenever I try to maximize their size - is it normal? Please help me with this. And I can't sort my songs. Whenever I press the sort - the on screen keyboard automatically pops up.,
Screen Size,Articles take long time to load or are not rendered at all. Full screen view of article keeps flickering. Nice effort - looks good but needs some work. As it is - it is not usable.,
Screen Size, Slide has finally matured to be a daily driver. So many customization options within this app that include all the best features from other Reddit apps. Everything to multi-column layout to humongous font size to loading all imagea gallery presentations ensure this app will be leading the pack for quite a while!,
Screen Size,Oh my god. This app is evolving into probably my favourite Reddit app right now - especially for tablets (dual column in portrait FTW!). Tons of customization and features - but with a small performance toll (it's not as smooth and responsive in scrolling etc. as a couple of other feature-packed apps I know). Also - changing the default post layout (such as hiding toolbar) makes the post margins/padding look too narrow and uneven - kind of hard on the eye - so I stick with full post view for the moment.  I definitely recommend the paid version - just for the multi-column mode.,
Screen Size,Best bible app I've found. Translations - maps and books all available offline. And night mode is great to save battery on amoled screens as well.,
Screen Size,Zoomed in by accident now I can't zoom out lame,
Screen Size, except for the bit that you can't set and scale your own wallpapers and it zooms in and it makes it look off,
Screen Size,Can zoom in to see more detail and also find other works by the same artist on Wikiart.,
Screen Size, Why does it zoom on the pictures? It was better when the picture's height was adjusted to the screen size.,
Screen Size, I have tried many but this is one of the best. Wishes - one more bigger font size for high resolution displays + change order of entries more easily + less line space.,
Screen Size, Does what I need - a widget for my tablet - but fonts are still too small. Need at least twice font size available for 2x2 view.,
Screen Size,I have been using the same  app for some time on a galaxy s2 and moved to  a  galaxy s5 but the font size has become ridiculous. Size 30 is barely a thin black line and size 72 is the same size as the icons at the top of the screen please  sort this out or I will be forced to find another book reader,
Screen Size, This reader is both powerful and fast. It requires less memory that any other reader while boasting widest amount of features.  Only thing that could be improved is interface and default settings. Full screen without toolbar is essential - changing intricacies of heading sizes is not as used.,
Screen Size,Can't even zoom into the text or magnify it....,
Screen Size, I am really enjoying your reader so far. The layout is clean - and there is a good amount of features. A couple things I would like to see is the ability to pinch zoom on a page (if the option is there - I couldn't find it) - and possibly speed up the page turns so its more fluid. Other than that - great job!,
Screen Size,no zoom - makes spreadsheets impractical to view,
Screen Size, I love this app. I use kiwix on all my devices and computers. However - there is no option to change the font size on the Android app. I use kiwix on my Samsung S4 and it renders everything fine - but I wish I had an option to adjust the screen font size. The app always presents the articles in small type - just small enough to be uncomfortable to read with no option to adjust the size. There is a zoom feature but that is very inconvenient because as soon as you zoom you crop the article and you are left having to manually move the page left - right - up and down as you read. I will give my fifth star once I see an update with font size adjustment.,
Screen Size, - please add wakelocks to keep the screen on (low contrast is fine but entering pincodes while presenting is annoying. - my phone screen is too small to read notes - but I do want the option to see the next slide(s) without switching over to it,
Screen Size, It doesn't work with devices with a big screen (well - 5 inch is not so big) - as the barcode view does not allow zooming out - the barcode becomes too big for most scanners.,
Screen Size,Good work - still cannot see 80% of the characters though. Evo 2.2 Ã£ÂƒÂœ,
Screen Size, It's a great app thanks for the work. Best planner ever. Although - the dark theme is not very good looking on big screen (the circle on the bottom right got a bad resolution),
Screen Size, There is still some tweeking todo - (pardon the pun).  The check off blocks are missing from the widget. They were in the original. There is only one widget to select from - even though it is expandable on my 10.1 tablet.    The lines seperating the tasks - in the dark mode - are a nice touch.  The ability to import the backup files from the original was also well received.,
Screen Size,kindly read my suggestion Need few more options 1- Who is reading or not reading our messages in group chat 2- Who is casting his her vote in poll option admin can seen. so he can tell those who is not voting 3- Events option 4- Reminder for Works 5- Notes 6- Home Screen icons are too small which take load on eyes. plz make it zoom or provide users to set size according to our choice hopefully you will consider on it and provide next update regarding this all features,
Screen Size,"Nothing to complain about. Everything looks good & works fine - just like the desktop version. However - if you could grant me two wish - I would hoping that you could give me an ""Extra Small"" size subtitle as an option because as of right now - the small is still kind of big in my 2014 720p display. Also - Sort by Date feature. Thanks!",
Screen Size,Full screen doesn't suit subtitle. Each time I use full screen subtitle goes under screen. please fix this.,
Screen Size,Don't understand why the pull-out index presentation was changed. The new one does not show the heading tree structure - and has spacing that allows fewer entries to be seen without scrolling. Please bring the old one back.,
Screen Size,The video is too zoomed in to allow editing. The quality also sucks,
Screen Size, I have a Galaxy S5 - and the video is so zoomed in that I can't even SEE the part of the video I'm trying to blur.,
Screen Size, Tested on Smartfren Andromax E2 B16C2H in late February 2018. It works to view and play my favorites Java Games (jar). But i am having problems to adjust screen size. I can't get the approriate screen size as i desired. On screen control needs improvement and option related with sensitivity and button size. Is there any way to adjust in-game font size match to the selected screen size? Is this app has version for Windows 10?,
Screen Size,The email body excerpt in the mailbox view is unreadable on my Mate 9. Text ,
Screen Size, This just a crippled android-vnc-viewer. A couple of promising new features are added (zeroconf - mouse tracking and two finger scrolling) - but you are stuck with a really poorly chosen input method and a highly crippled screen realestate.,
Screen Size, Images are highly zoomed by default and there is no way to unzoom them - even in big screen mobile post are not scalded to size.revert back to old version.,
Screen Size,"I'm using FB only to communicate with some groups and don't want to install an app due to bloat and privacy concerns. It has it's limitations - but you can't have both. On a Chromebook with a 13 -3"" @ 1920x1080 screen and Force desktop site the FB site is zoomed in too much and complains about an outdated browser. Ideally it should also support resizing when not maximized.",
Screen Size, The only think I miss is zoom out beyond mobile's screen resolution (fit to screen).,
Screen Size, On my Samsung galaxy 3 evey thig is small is it possible to make it zoom in by adding a pinch the screen thing to zoom in it help alot but other then that its funn game thanks,
Screen Size, Best game ever!!! One thing you should add is a way to zoom in!:) other than that its amazing Ã¢ÂÂ¤,
Screen Size, UPDATE: After the updates -  this app is hard to use. The opening page doesn't fit the screen -  so you have to page down to open projects. Size also effects the projects page.  Save etc buttons are hard to see.                  This is a great app. You can track multiple projects at the same time. Also you can add as many items inside the project as you want (I have yet to hit a limit). This is a definite must have app for all knitters. Thanks for this app.,
Screen Size,I wish epub pics were easier to zoom +/-,
Screen Size, Frequently used programming symbols - like '=' - are just as difficult to use as the stock keyboards in portrait mode. It matters because on small screen devices landscape mode makes it difficult to see the text typed. Very good otherwise.,
Screen Size,Scaling doesn't work - where are all the layouts?!,
Screen Size,i have a samsung note 8. when i launch the program it zooms in making it impossibe to see the entire screen please fix,
Screen Size,Subtitles are not shown when casting,
Uniformity,"Screen cast needs more work, who would want to watch a video with 10 fps",
Uniformity, The best and Light-weight browser on Android. I hope there are more features like Bookmarks Sync with Google and better zooming capability. Love it Ã¢Â™Â¥.,
Uniformity, Thank you dev.  Love the ui.  Love the smoothness.  By the way -  thanks for the improved ads block and black theme.  Gonna love it compare to the other browser.,
Uniformity, As said in other reviews - this app saves edits in another place - with no customization options s to where our gets saved. I want an ODT editor that works - this wasn't it. Uninstalled.,
Uniformity,as an elderly person - I for one would like for the app to have the voice search working. I know it not as easy as it sounds but a worthy cause just yhe same. In my case I think I've worn out spell check plus because of my vision i can't see how it (text) is doing as far as getting thru to those i try to send messages to it can take hours to do so. Thank you for putting up with oldies like me...,
Uniformity,By far the most-used app on my phone (not counting social media). Deckbuilder - card search - life counter and die rolls are all simple to use and have all the necessary functions. The card trader/pricer and the comprehensive rules get used less by me but are still helpful when needed. The app comes with an adjustable homescreen widget so you can quickly access only those features that you frequently use and the dev is active on github and promptly responds to any bug reports / suggestions.,
Uniformity, The app is good. The blanket statement in the disclaimer regarding epilepsy tells me that the developer has not sought the advice of a neurologist at the time of writing...,
Uniformity,Clean and organized UI - very accurate in syncing the song metadata and no ads,
Uniformity, Clean materialistic UI. Equaliser. Customizations. Ad free. Open source,
Uniformity, Simple clean and has most of the music essentials a player requires - browsers - simple customizations which do not require an extra installed app (skins) . All in all i love it. I only gave 4* because it does not have an equalizer (no equaliser can be found). When that will be available all my stars will light up.,
Uniformity,Loving this app! I switched when the default messages app got rid of individual colors for each person's message bubbles and made my outgoing messages blue instead of grey (I like having incoming messages be colorful). I love the pure black dark mode since it's nice for OLED screens. Messages seem to send a lot quicker than the stock Android messages too and I don't get any failed to send notifications like I used to. One issue I am having is that my contacts don't update new numbers that text me even after I add them to my contacts - but otherwise things have been smooth.,
Uniformity,Sync with fullest expert control on any device (android - pc - linux) with a forget-and-set encryption sync of any folder you wish to retain crucial metadata (versioning - exif - cross-platform compatibility - etc). It's not for everyone - looking at you grandma - but for power users - this is a great sychronization tool for mobility at its finest! Worth donating to,
Uniformity,Perfect app now that you can upload direct from camera. Only wish that ,
Uniformity,The best unit converter I've used. I primarily use this app for cooking and ,
Uniformity,This app is now the perfect app. It out performs QuickPic by every metric. Unlike QP it does not surf the net. QP uses the internet more than you. Simple brought back zooming Gifs and the whole package is BUTTAH! I refuse to update. I learned my lesson on Android. Don't mess w/a good thing,
Uniformity,Please make gif zooming function same as jpg image zooming.,
Uniformity,So far the best gallery app. One thing that buggs me: When I open a PhotoSphere trough this app I'm unable to zoom it. Zooming works when I open it with Photos app.,
Uniformity,I like this browser very much. I wish the developer would make it more ,
Uniformity, Zooms in too far - hate the whole layout. Why mess with a good thing,
Uniformity,Password text fields should never have autocompletion features. The app looks suitable for what I was looking for except for that little detail.   This has two bad consequences - the first (obvious) one is that your phone may decide it knows better than yourself the password you are typing - and substitute it.  The second (much more dangerous) consequence is that - once you have written that password - your keyboard will remember it. After this - ANYONE using your phone may discover it easily - for example by simply start typing in Google with the same first letters of your password and then having a look at your keyboard's suggestions.  I have some experience with Android - so I know that it is relatively easy to change the input type of a text field so that it knows it is intended for passwords. With that detail solved - the app would be ideal.,
Uniformity,Great app. But it lacks consistency in the way it handles the swaps in the ,
Uniformity, My main podcast finding - following - downloading - and listening app. No more messing with meta tags and scattered sources. Objectives of some features are still a little obscure to me (logs vs episodes vs queue) but I'm using it with 0 problems and with all the utility stated above. When I figure these additional features out I'm sure I'll be even more pleased. 2 thoughts: 1) tooltips might have helpful educational utility. 2) searching and adding podcasts isn't the prettiest.,
Uniformity, Thanks to the developer. It works accurately as mentioned. Trust me - this is the best out there. Specially for the separate controls of wifi and cellular data. Another thing - the dark theme is a very nice one. But  one last request-please make this app to the kitkat users as well.(also upcoming marshmallow). My device- huawei G7 plus(upgradable to marshmallow)Ã¢Â€Â¦a question- DOES THE VPN CREATED BY THIS APP AFFECTS THE CELLULAR DATA TOO LIKE THE RANDOM VPN APPS??,
Uniformity, I've been using it for years as the best app - and recently it just got better with split screen and custom screen timeout. With no ads - this really is one of the very best apps on Google Play.,
Uniformity, I really like it. Nice -  Clean simple.  The no pinch To zoom is a deal breaker for me though.  Perhaps in a future update? I'll try a few more apps .  Maybe give this one another look at a later time..,
Uniformity, This is my go-to wallpaper app. I am wondering if the dev could add a setting to decide if the wallpaper chosen can be shown in full rather than the zoom currently. Its not easy to explain - but the photos coming in from Reddit are high resolution and muzei shows pixels at 1:1 with phone resolution. Would like option to zoom out or show the whole image? Hopefully you know what I mean.,
Uniformity,"After installing the free version - I downloaded 400 mb of maps. Then I upgraded to ""+""  It didn't see the downloads and asked if I wanted maps. When I pay for an app - I shouldn't have to do the developer's work. A GPX route with plenty of waypoints that is perfect on any Garmin comes out wrong - even where maps are identical. It can take 10 minutes to calculate a route. It goes into night mode uncontrollably.",
Uniformity,great app! I use it all the zman - yishar koach. can you please add a widget with a larger hebrew date - or even a date only small widget?,
Uniformity,Works exactly as advertised. Love the audio cues,
Uniformity, Simple and smooth UI - doesn't affect my battery too much. I would love an option to zoom in !,
Uniformity, Best app for tasks. Only some improvements needed: 2x2 list widget not available on my phone - only on my tablet. Only 1x1 shortcut shown on phone under widgets. Phone: Samsung s2 - CM11. Also needs a way to manually order lists under menu and tasks in each list. Would be nice if widget text size could be changed. Keep up the good work. Would gladly donate if these things are added. Update (widget fix),
Uniformity, Loving the app. The only thing missing is a volume amplification option. If there's one - I haven't been able to find it. Also wake on Lan doesn't seem to work. Yes bios is set to wake on Lan.,
Uniformity,Everything you need - and nothing you don't. Dark theme - yay! Number row - yay! No spell checker - footprint so tiny it doesn't even register on task manager and no tracking or data mining BS. Thank you kind soul!,
Uniformity,This app is miles ahead of K9 mail in terms of privacy - UX and the ease of setting up gmail accounts. Much love to the devs and their hard work! I would give this 5 stars - but all this app is missing is a dark theme for AMOLED screens. I love this app so far - and I'm looking forward to new updates coming in the future!,
Uniformity, However - back-to-back events that are each 30 minutes in length position diagonally to each other (don't fit into single-hour boxes) if you zoom in too much. Lastly - you can't choose to NOT e-mail updates to guests. That's a big feature miss Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â• But it's far cleaner to navigate with its boxy design!,
Uniformity,Hey great app developer - the best music player ever - just that - if search ,
Uniformity, Never let me down and has a volume fader,
Uniformity,Simple. Works. Love the gradual volume increase.,
Uniformity,needs volume control within the app thatis separate from android main volume control.,
Uniformity, That sound that's in every single preset gives me a headache. Maybe it's just me - but my volume was low and it made my head hurt.,
Uniformity,Restarts driver when changing orientation. Please fix that. Additionally would like to have MUTE button alongside with other buttons. Another issue is: let user choose whether he/she wants kHz - MHz or GHz when entering freq. Thanks in advance!  Could you please add Ettus USRP support? Like Ettus B200/B210 via USB or Ettus N210 via network?,
Uniformity,This worked great on my HTC M9... I was thrilled. I had to upgrade and chose the HUAWEI P10. For some reason the app cannot control the speakerphone and mute... A huge disappointment as used both extensively... Help??,
Uniformity,Add customs notification alert  ... Sound alert mute option ...   Even messaging( active session in web )  in web sound alert in mobile .,
Uniformity, Has a ton of features - follows consistent UI guidelines - the overlay feature is an added bonus. One thing I think would be awesome is to have an option to automatically decrease the device's volume when someone is talking to better hear them. That and an option to decrease the volume of other people while you're talking so you can talk at the same time as someone without your mic also picking them up. Even without these features - a really solid app.,
Uniformity, If you want to control your music in your pc from phone - you definitely want to have this. The windows counterpart was epic. I can edit and fix cover arts - metadata of songs effortlessly. This app is very small yet has a clean interface and more importantly smooth when transitioning from submenus. Keep it up guys. Please keep this app smooth.,
Uniformity, Way better than the stock app the new slider feature excellent addition to a already great app keep up the good work I recommend this app for anybody that has subsonic server This is the 2nd time I have been here just have a suggestion a volume control in the player would be really nice   the new update really messed the volume up won't turn up or down it put a phone volume on my tab 2 I have to go into settings to control the media volume and you can't turn the Bluetooth on without it pausing all the time,
Uniformity,"Compared with the Sword Project app on iOS (PocketSword) - I was very pleased to discover that this ""And Bible"" app also supports:  * multiple synchronized windows * verse comparisons for multiple translations * off-line text-to-speech audio.  Some enhancements found in the iOS PocketSword app that I would also like to see here:  1. Display commentary for an entire chapter (just like an entire Bible chapter is displayed) - and not just commentary for one verse.  2. Immediately display the footnote info when I tap on the highlighted footnote letter (just like a Strong's number definition is immediately displayed) instead of requiring me to first select the verse and then choose from the context menu ""Footnotes and references"".  3. Show results from my previous 'find' so that I can easily visit each search result and not have to repeat the search.  4. Add the ability to download new modules from user-defined locations.  I already have many text & commentary modules shared from a non-public server - and it was awkward to have to manually copy them onto the Android device.   But even without these requested enhancements - I'm happy to have a Sword Project compatible app on Android!",
Uniformity,This is by far my favorite keyboard - I own a lot of android devices and ,
Uniformity,"SAME as ALL THE OTHERS. It doesn't matter whether it's communist dumb phones(apple) or androids -  there must be a SIMPLE way to disable Autoplay on bluetooth. If you can't do that -  you are no better than ALL the other player apps. If you are able to accomplish it -  make it EASY for end users.  A button - switch - whatever. FAQs are full of"" similar complaints""  - NO ANSWERS.",
Uniformity,Control is a mess compared to any other video player. You should improve ,
Uniformity,Such a great application - but they keep removing core functionality - and the performance just gets worse. Can't even get ssh to work anymore - had this running on all my media devices in the house - one auto update - and suddenly my kids can't access their media - and I need to go through the massive task to reconfigure every device in my house. I think the kodi dev team got replaced by a bunch of inexperienced teens. 0 consistency - 0 reliability - 0 performance - wish I could revert to XBMC,
Uniformity, Needs to be tested on more devices - faced few overlapping ui elements,
Uniformity, One idea - a widget with simple playback controls  - and use of ir blaster for supported phones so you can do TV volume . I use osmc on a raspberry pi attached to a Samsung smart TV and have to use Samsung remote to do the volume of TV  -I use a HTC One m9 with ir  blaster and OT would be great if you could consolidate .,
Uniformity, Good concept - doesn't do 80% of what I want. Not very configurable. Generic design. No tab - skip or mute button. No indication of whether the program has crashed or you're simply experiencing network delay. No indication on device of a volume change. No volume change is possible with the rocker buttons unless you're actually on the remote screen - and the phone is on. Unreliable in the event  that you suddenly need to pause or mute the video. May work well for specific use cases - but mine is not one of them.,
Uniformity,Please show a Play/Pause Buttons for all instances - for sync playback ,
Uniformity, All the essentials are there - navigating is easy enough - interface is nice and clean - back menu shortcut buttons etc. Drawbacks/Improvements would be to add the ability to customize shortcuts - the toggle full screen under the more options doesn't work for me - send text seems tedious - a touch screen/mouse gesture would be nice - maybe more audio/subtitle controls (off on speed up slow down etc),
Uniformity,App is good - but can't control volume by volume key in other than main remote view window.,
Uniformity, Aside from the clean look - I purchased this app because I really admire the way it handles tabs (sliding in from the left) and bookmarks (sliding in from the right).  The more I use it - the more I'm coming to appreciate the simplicity and consistency of its design. Plus - it's one of the few browsers that looks good on my tablet. UPDATE:  The addition of ad blocking removed the last hurdle to making this my default browser.,
Uniformity, Some websites - mine included - displays a gray background instead of white. I didn't set a bg color on my body and every other browser displays white but this one prefers the gray side. Sometimes major sites like Google and others will show as having a gray bg color as well. Please fix. Free version doesnt have this issue. Also - instead of 5 different font sizes - make an option to enter exact percentage because 3rd option is too small and 4th is a bit too big. 120% is ideal imho.,
Uniformity,No option to change notification sound - messages are delayed - sometimes up to 15 minutes - no dark mode - zero customizable options. Using on a Pixel 3,
Uniformity,I like your Just Notes applications but I think applications could use new look that's more more polish & professional - applications settings need a more polish & professional look plus email syncing capability witch allow users to access notes across multiple device using there existing email accounts like Yahoo - Gmail - Hotmail & iCloud would be perfect for user Ios - mac along with rom support so user can add to there rom as source code & nor a prebuilt apk - better theme selection and dark mode as well along with pixel app icon would perfect.,
Uniformity, One of the things I liked about the old version were the big buttons and simple interface.  It's a calculator - not an art project.  I've since removed and reverted to my stock Samsung built in calc - which is lousy with small buttons - also.,
Uniformity, What happened?! No more dark theme? No more keypress vibrations? No more customization? No thanks. I'll come back when you figure yourself out - calculator.,
Uniformity, Works as advertised. Any issues you may experience are usually FB mobile site issues. [crashing is due to FB forcing FB Messenger on users. You can only see messages via the FB Messenger App now. Not Devs fault - blame Zuckerberg!]  Thanks Dev! Nice and clean. The only thing I'd want is a dark/night mode.,
Uniformity,This app is sooooo perfect!!! The dev even thought about leftys(you can change the position of the controlpanel) Also you can add quite some nice customizations  and also choose between fullscale color shading and BW-shading which is wonderful.,
Uniformity, But lacking in customization - and I'm not a fan of the styles it generates.,
Uniformity,Plain and simole. No ads and does everything I want in a notepad. Imports - saves - selects multiple - has a dark theme and easy to use. Best on the app store.,
Uniformity, Could you add night mode? You know - white text on black background.. Thanks! Update: Thanks for the dark theme. But actually what I really mean is the lyric itself that is white with black background (to reduce eyestrain) - not just the action bar. Well - it's only my preference anyway. Great app nonetheless Ã°ÂŸÂ˜Â€,
Uniformity,Has worked great for pretty much every song I've tried so far - even the more obscure ones.   Subscription vs paid - well I understand - and $5 a year is pretty cheap for the great app you get.  (And thanks for the dark theme!),
Uniformity,A good start. Lacks customization in the widget. It would be nice to add ,
Uniformity,Absolutely amazing. Everything I've looked for in a music player. Plays most files except AIF I believe. But it plays all my FLAC and others just fine - while adding the simplistic Material design and customization. Anytime I torrent or download music onto my phone - it immediately adds it to my library whereas most apps I've used require you to rescan the phone for new files. I can't see myself using any other app now. Every update stabilizes it further and only makes me love it more. Thank you Karim! Will keep an eye for your future apps and recommend this one to anyone in need of a simple - stylish - and functional music player.,
Uniformity, Having used many music apps - this currently free beta app excels in many ways. Light on memory - quick - lovely interface - minimalist (no unnecessary icons & tabs) - great integration in Lollipop - super-simple drag/touch sleep timer - FOLDERS (implemented the right way - file structures maintained) - option to set default folder - dynamic play cue (rearrange on-the-fly) - option for 3 backgrounds (love the light theme) - mangle-free album tags (if tagging is done right) - & clean widget. Winner! None come close!,
Uniformity,No dark theme,
Uniformity,Don't like the new update I always used the sleep timer and had it in dark mode also the UI now looks bad I got this app for the clean ui but it's seems I'll be looking for another app,
Uniformity,Great App. I feel like it's near perfect - the only things missing are some more features and customization.,
Uniformity, For phones with only Software keys for Back - Home - etc. If you scroll right for different conversion units in the App - there is No way to Scroll back to starting point quickly. The conversion choices should be a vertical list with a scroll bar as its easier to get to where you want to go. Also a white theme for day time use in sun light would be good. The App itself is 5 stars but the GUI is lacking. Still 5 stars. No ads - no privacy issues. Thanks you!,
Uniformity, just made it as my default msg app... i hope u had already fixed d add recipient bar esp. on d black theme.. d letters and d box are same in color. but overall it was great. kipup!!!,
Uniformity, The only suggestion I have is putting the same contact/different numbers all into one thread - instead of having different threads. I have multiple numbers for people - but I don't want to delete them because I want to keep them in the thread. And I can't change the message font size. I can change the settings font size - but not when I'm in a message thread. Otherwise - this app is really great!!,
Uniformity,Good app with ability to mark messages as unread which is a huge plus for me. However - it has limited customizations and the deal breaker for me is that you can't add a signature line. Using paid version.,
Uniformity,Nice redesign - shame about not being able to offer the old colour personalisation yet but I am very happy with a full amoled black theme.  The app itself is very stable - I've never experienced issues except where sometimes opening an SMS notification doesn't actually open it on the recipient's conversation itself.  The only feedback I have (which I have shared on the tracker) is to allow us to use our system font. I don't like lato - it's not a well designed font which is overused - and I think that in an app where you spend 99% of the time reading you should have control over the font.,
Uniformity,Great so far! I've been playing with a variety of messaging apps and decided on this one. The super black mode is very welcome. I decided to pay the max donation to show support. The one thing I don't see is a way to send multiple pics at the same time. Other than that it checks all the boxes on my list of needs. Oh and I see the dev is actively responding to comments so that's awesome.,
Uniformity,This has a lot of potential. There's a few shortcomings but overall it's very functional. *Mobile numbers only* is a great feature. Ergonomics are good but not perfect - themes are good - decent selection of settings including some that even the other flexible apps do not - no ads - no bloat. Floating compose box is great. Night mode and color options are good. I found it sometimes very slow to display avatars in long threads. Attachments limited to photos & contacts - no auto-delete. (3.6.4),
Uniformity, the best messaging replacement app I've seen. I'm running the latest HTC rom on my One M7 - so the UI is already looking more material and similar to Lollipop - but might not get Lollipop until Feb 2015. So this app makes my messages match with the feel of the rest of my phone - and the customization is great for a free version of the app.,
Uniformity, Limited customisation. Can't alter the size of the bubble font without altering all font sizes? Can't alter bubble colours - limited to app colours or black. No repeating notifications. Can't alter day & night start settings? Uninstalled.,
Uniformity, Just what a tasks app should be. Blends perfectly with ICS. five stars! Two things i'd like to see though: Smaller font size on the widget and ability to check V near completed tasks on widget. Also timed notifications...  None the less these features are minor. Awesome job!,
Uniformity,Super useful - folder syncing between devices ... without expensive cloud service. If i dont run across glitches - this is gonna be one of my favorite apps. Makes things so much easier. One suggestion.... Dark theme option please - your app should be very easy to apply a dark theme toggle to. When you update the app with a dark theme toggle - i will change rating to 5 stars.,
Uniformity, OMG Orgzly is PERFECTION - I'm so happy I found it! Such a natural way of organizing information. I love how you can combine notes with tasks and reminders. Everything's just there!  I also really appreciate the dark mode but wish there was also a true black mode for devices with amoled screens... I'll be eagerly awaiting the Google Drive sync integration as I'm not using Dropbox.,
Uniformity, I love this so much. Thank you for your generous effort! And as a UX guy - here are some easy-to-do suggestions that will change the life of your users: Make the font size in both list and editor bigger by default. Now although users can have bigger font size in setting - the big font setting makes everything so big - which is not optimal for most users. While having a small font size option may serve some users well - I would say most of the users will want bigger font size in the list and editor,
Uniformity, After searching and trying endlessly converters this one is a must have. Very niece selection of units and the ability to switch to dark mode is fantastic. How do I donate?,
Uniformity,Great app - easy to use - dark theme - all the conversions I could want - no ,
Uniformity, Only missing a dark theme for the main view. Otherwise absolutely seamless and without peer in this space.,
Uniformity,Image view animation is very annoying. Darkening and brightening together ,
Uniformity,Best gallery app I've seen. Feature rich - fast - excellent zoom - and custom themes.,
Uniformity,This is ( I think) The best Gallery app around. No frills - but also no ads. Just enough Customization... Lightweight and as the name says.. Simple. Thank you for the PRO version - it's was nice of you guys.,
Uniformity,The Ui is beautiful. Please change the color of the dark theme to light grey because it's too dark and it hurt my eyes,
Uniformity, Very little contrast. Bad for old eyes.,
Uniformity,Loved the interface .simple. Clean . the best app for crossword !  Thanks for night mode,
Uniformity, I love the app itself - a great electronic version of crosswords....especially the NYT - which I subscribe to. But I hate the new keyboard - it's tiring and too hard to see. In fairness (I guess) - I've hated the design of all the new Materials Design layouts - so maybe this Google's problem?,
Uniformity, Thanks for fixing the flicker issue. Now the app is perfect! If you still get flicker - try force restarting the app or restarting your phone/tablet,
Uniformity,Beautiful update!! Thanks so much. Loving the uni - spacings - colours -  everything!,
Uniformity, No tricks or annoying ads - you just load up an ovpn file and that's it - just like you'd do on a *nix system except that with a friendly and understandable GUI.,
Uniformity,Simple app. Minimalistic UI. Love the dark mode.,
Uniformity,"Wonderful - effective - and easy to use. The new icon is great though it's unfortunate that ""Voice"" overlaps with so many apps. I use this daily - it's probably the most used app on my phone. Definitely do let us know if there's ever a way of making a donation.",
Uniformity,Does all you need - but lacks customization.,
Uniformity,Elegant UI - adjustable speed - support for equalizer - responsive developer team and no hiccups. Perfect app! I'm a regular listener of audiobooks and I've tried every other app out there and I can say - this one gets every aspect right - do try it,
Uniformity,The UI is really nice. The app performs well - plays a good range of local file formats - both single file audiobooks as well as folders containing many smaller files. Has a beautiful dark mode - sleep timer - variable playback speed. It's perfect.,
Uniformity, It's quite hard to find out the current status of my contacts - as the only way is to view conversation details or look at what colour the send button is. It would be much more intuitive to have a coloured circle next to the contact's names in the roster to indicate their status.  Also - I got this app from F-droid for free. It doesn't seem logical to me for the app to be free on one app store and paid on another... Especially since this is open source software. It's a pain to have to get my friends to download and install F-droid to be able to use the best XMPP client - although it's not that bad.  There aren't many theming options. Although it is nice to have a dark theme - it would be even better to be able to customise the main colour of the app - like Xabber. Options for different shaped message bubbles would also be welcome.   Apart from these small problems - in my opinion this is a well designed - intuitive app that is perfect for chatting over XMPP. It's fast - responsive and customisable. Great work - dev(s)!,
Uniformity, No gimmicks or bloat. Night mode. Comment editing and deletion. 10/10,
Uniformity, Running 4.1.2 I get a flickering background when in the internal browser. Other than that  - its perfection,
Uniformity,brilliant app! was very functional before the recent changes but the new UI is great. dark theme is there. this is the quickest - easiest and pretty reliable way of sharing your screen!,
Uniformity,Great app. Font is black and hard to see when filling info in. N1 2.3.3,
Uniformity,Great app and always getting great new updates! Plus dark mode is the best!!,
Uniformity,Lovely - hate to manually go to each site and have browser tabs eating memory. Keep up the good work and begging for a dark theme.,
Uniformity,Very nice app. But the one problem is that - I can't see some of the Unicode characters and they appear as boxes to me.,
Uniformity,It's handy to have a thing like this on the go - but it kind of needs some polishing up before you can really be charging 99 cents for it. The foremost issue is that oftentimes some information won't get saved - such as the character's names - or its two top aspects - for example.   That aside - other features to focus on moving forward are of course the ability to sync this app with other devices - since this is at its heart an informational reference app. Another important emphasis looks like it will be in expanding data types. What this refers to is things like adding descriptions to each aspect to elaborate upon - usually done to suggest a few ideas for invokes and compels. Stunts might want to be set up in a similar fashion - such that their names can collapse what could often be elaborate descriptions as to what they do. Stress uses up a lot more vertical space than it really needs to - and it would probably be for the best to enable the user to create new stress tracks for more modded games.   Minor details probably include things like being able to label consequence slots with letters to differentiate the specialized physical or mental stress consequences one gains at +5 in the respective skill. Another useful idea might be to create groups underneath a header. For example - on the main Fate Sheets screen - a user may want to organize their characters by genre - or by PCs versus mooks. Users might also find use in organizing aspects or stunts in this manner. It couldn't hurt to future-proof - and it's possible to accomplish these things without cluttering up the screen too much.,
Uniformity, This app is the most feature filled Reddit client there is at the moment. Developer pushes new updates day and night. Bugs gets fixed in matter of hours. Offers the greatest amount of customization - even per subreddit. A few subtle material-design animations here and there wouldn't hurt though. I have all of the most popular Reddit clients but this is the one I keep coming back to.,
Uniformity, Used a few other reddit apps in the past - but this one is easily the winner. Runs smoothly and has great customization options.,
Uniformity, I love this app - and I use it everyday! Love the material design and usability! Better than reddit is fun golden edition! Keep up the good work - and please continue to add more features - settings - and customizations!,
Uniformity, Great App! No flaws... Buy after the new update the app does not save my prefered setting for font size - it goes back to the font size 30 which is too small - everytime I exit the app,
Uniformity,Have been using this app for about 2 years now. Never had a problem till I got a new phone. Every time I exit the app - the font size and the brightness are set to default. Really annoying.,
Uniformity, Some of my lists have many entries. New items are arranged at the bottom. An intuitive approach would be the other way around. However: Try to add 3 new tasks to an existing list of 50 - then arrange the new ones on top. No dark theme available. It is free and it seems to be the only app compatible with CalDAV tasks - so I gave 2 stars.,
Uniformity,Worked straight away - synchronising with my CalDav accounts from OpenSync. ,
Uniformity,I've just downloaded it and I already feel it has everything it needs to be a great app: clean interface - light and dark themes - simple structure - interesting analysis - no ads - no in-app purchases - this really annoys me - especially when they're expensive and you're looking for a free app. I guess the dev is a truly user of it seeking simplicity and straight to the point of building better habits.,
Uniformity,Easy to use. Nice layout. I like the night mode setting.,
Uniformity,I love the design! All you need and so much more (there is even a night mode with a true black background),
Uniformity,Simple - uncluttered interface. Love the night mode look. Does what it needs to and not more.,
Uniformity,It's awesome. Interface is very clean. Some customisation features like clubbing similar habits under one umbrella as one project - font size and type. But I still love this.,
Uniformity,"This app is near perfect.   I love that it has pure black mode however I'd like it if the grey checks are brighter.  My biggest wishlist feature would be an option for various persistent ringtone notification intervals.  I'd like the app to continually beep at me until I've acknowledged the alert as I have missed reminders regularly.  Widgets are great.  Although I have a workaround for multiple times a day -  it would be nice as a native feature.  Another wishlist feature:  Allow a different time of day to ""reset"" to the next day.  I am a night owl so some of my tasks happen past midnight.  So it would be great if I can set 2am as the time to roll-over.",
Uniformity,I tried several habit tracker apps then I stop here - only needs couple of seconds to figure out how it works. Simple - minimalist interface and I don't need to purchase night mode also the statistics including everything which is so useful to see how the habit progress. I'm so appreciate your app. Free adds - no in-app purchase. Good bless you. Ã°ÂŸÂ‘Â,
Uniformity,excelente!! in the future all apps should be like this one - easy to understand and manage - nice design - dark mode available  - no ads and no intrusive permissions - in one word PERFECT Ã°ÂŸÂ‘ÂŒ! and thanks,
Uniformity,LG Nexus 5 And.6.0.1 [now beta7.11.18] It Works. Love the small app size & simplicity. (Bought an online cinema ticket - could have just used barcode screenshot - but I like knowing the other details + the offline use). Haven't needed the contrast setting - but good to know it's there. It means I'll be more likely to buy online tickets from now on.,
Uniformity,Tried several apps and stuck with this. It's simple and straight to the point - exactly the way it should be. A lot other apps offer too many unnecessary features or a terrible UI. We primarily use it for fair tickets - so we won't have to print them out. The automatic light option is awesome. And this one of the apps that knows how important a dark theme is.,
Uniformity, If you need to do any terminal work - remote Linux system administration - programing or anything that requires symbols and control keys - this is the keyboard to use.,
Uniformity, Not the sort of keyboard you would use on a day to day basis but essential if you're using telnet or accessing any services that require or are simplified by a standard full PC keyboard including control keys.,
Uniformity," The only things i might ask of is to have an option to make the autocorrect height independent of the height option  (appearing above it)  EVERYONE WHO COMPLAINS ABOUT THE COLORS AND FONTS- Give them a break. This is based off the Gingerbread keyboard and you can see that it is the standard GB behavior to not change the font size and to be very tall in landscape (Try ""Keyboard from Android 2.3"" by Steven Lin to compare.) If they based it off ICS  froyo support would be a pain.",
Uniformity,Great app with useful arrow and ctrl keys immediately accessible. Same layout as pc too - so when the fat key hw limitation of capacitive multitouch is overcome then the right kb is in use. One issue - the Ã‚Â£ sign is missing on the 5 row layout and not shown in small on the full layout. Would also be helpful if the word suggestion bar said to download dictionary if unavailable.,
Uniformity, ... without having to configure your device's input method every time you connect a HW keyboard. Saved my day.,
Uniformity, Minimalistic. Just download files and does it well. Must have). UPD: Please - add the dark theme for AMOLED,
Uniformity,Cleaner layout... please include Option for dark mode. Observed increase battery consumption when using the app....,
Uniformity,More better features than Google Indical Keyboards.Needed improvement in ,
Uniformity,I was a long time user of Astrid - and this is exactly like it and looks even better! Has some good customization options and the widget looks clean. Kudos to the developer! My only wish is that some day they can develop a desktop version that will sync - (for a one time payment I won't subscribe) that would be epic.,
Uniformity,Really fantastic app. I used to use Astrid religiously and have been searching for a replacement ever since. After bouncing through apps like Todoist and RTM - I'm glad I found this. Nextcloud sync is great. Love the customization with tags - lists - and filters. Location support is a godsend. It's not perfect - but it's well on its way.,
Uniformity, The Astrid task manager was a life saver - but when it was sold it had no equal that I could find. Ease of use and customization were always missing from other apps. Alex has done a great job cloning the original app. I use multiple lists or sometimes just lazily tack in to an existing list and set it and forget it...until it reminds me. Thanks for the great addition to my smartphone!,
Uniformity," Does everything I want and works - my only request is to be able to sort torrents in this order from top to bottom (maybe using the ""Status"" filter): currently downloading/uploading/suspended - not downloaded but inactive - downloaded but inactive. Also the green color on the dark theme isn't great. Thanks for the app.",
Uniformity,It works i love u VLC!!!!! Best BEST BEST EVER PLAYER FOR.ANDROID PHONE BEST USER INTERFACE BEST SELECTIVE OPTIONS SUBTITLE DOWNLOADER VOLUME BOOSTER AND EVEN BEST THERE IS NO ADDS AND ITS FREE DEVELOPERS SALUTE TO YOUR AMAZING WORK BEST PLAYSTORE VIDEO PLAYER BY ABHISHEK,
Uniformity,it needs auto app theme feature. light app yheme on day time and dark theme on night.,
Uniformity,The app does not work properly with TalkBack when the English UK keyboard PC layout is enabled.,
Uniformity,Font size of lowercase letters is sooo small! How to change it? It should be like on google keybord when you change capital/lowercase mode - lowercase letters have almost the same size as capital. It's much easier for your eyes!,
Uniformity,A great keyboard that doesn't have unnecessary permissions and features. My dislikes are the secondary icons on the keys are very small - the dollar sign on the D key cannot be swapped for my local currency (Ã‚Â£) and adding a permanent number row squashes all the letters. Typos are no longer underlined for me (Google issue?). Typing sound volume cannot be changed (regardless of system volume). Overall it is a very solid keyboard - not packed full of unnecessary bloat - IAPs or potential snooping.,
Uniformity,Yes ! This is what I looking for. But add more theme please ? Just like Gboard. Theme colors pick and font sizing - this keyboard will perfect.,
Uniformity,Finally. A truly simple - no-fuss - no-gizmos - no-emojis keyboard that is good-looking (maybe not best - but it definitely is way above okay) - with only the useful swipe gestures and uses Android design language. Thank you very much! p.s. Please don't add any more features. It actually worth 6 or 7 stars this way.,
Uniformity,Now THIS is a minimalist keyboard! Small size - ONLY 5mb of ram consumption! This is by far the BEST minimalistic keyboard app i have ever seen. I have a request though - since I love this app and this will be the only keyboard app I will ever use - can you guys make an option where the ENTER KEY in the material light theme just be plane black or white? I am sure lots of people like it that way - just clean and plain - no colors - especially green. Anyway! GREAT APP! THANK YOU (:,
Uniformity,Well - I tried downloading an AOSP keyboard via side-loaded APK - but as it turns out it's a pickier process and not having exactly Android 7.1.2 or Android 8.1 makes it crash repeatedly. This is the only keyboard that respects the basic - truly stock Android keyboard form and function. It has all the basic necessary options GBoard does such as Dark & Light themes - custom colors - number row and haptic feedback. The only thing it doesn't have is that laggy Emoji and GIF selector. As an aside - by the way Google - these extraneous features at least need a proper UI that keeps it clean and one-hand friendly...,
Uniformity, A very minimal app. Could do with more customization options like no showing wind speed and/or humidity. I find it ok to use it without skin with standard Lollipop notification appearance.,
Uniformity,Please make your app this design . 1.Make screen like mobile phone when touch is disable. 2.Change Actionbar Color . 3.Hide Status Bar . (when a user browse file for open jar file) 4.change font size . 5.change folder icon . (when installing app) 6.Make Like as Android app installer . You are a good developer . If you make your app like top discription you will get more rate or donation . Thank You .,
Uniformity,Awesome Application. But I'm missing three default font style of ,
Uniformity,A very worthy Gallery replacement since default Gallery app was removed from Android Lollipop. I really like the Parallax effect and the Material Design dark theme. Only thing missing are editing option and filters but overall still a great app.,
Uniformity, This is a very good music player especially considering that it's free. One of the few apps I really feel obligated to rate. The Replay Gain is a really nice tool that makes up for android's lack of volume control. One problem is that there is no update library button. I use the Music Player app to update. The libraries are connected do it works great.,
Uniformity," Loving this app - I have now uninstalled the official FB app and just using TinFoil. Only problem is no notifications in Android task bar so you have to open the app and check there - no biggie - worth it to get FB off my phone!! FB app = 138mb - TinFoil = 14mb  Dev should also add a ""rate it"" link in the settings somewhere :)  UPDATE: took a star off - no zoom/scaling of pics - can't upload pic without official FB app installed. (SG5)",
Uniformity,Works great on my droid x - only problem is my zoom won't work when I'm using this app.,
Uniformity, This just instantly replaced Musixmatch for me.  For those reading - this is a super convenient lyric reading app. Good choice of color and design (Material certainly doesn't look hard to adapt - but then again even Google has trouble with consistency) - incredibly easy to use - super minimal - and totally free. It's just what you need in a lyric app.,
Uniformity,werkt goed perfect ...thanks. only volume button to smal,
Uniformity, QKSMS looks great and if not for some functional issues with group messages and night view mode - it would likely be able to replace my main texting app. As of now I cannot find a way of viewing everyone on a group message easily - and with a lot of group texts I cannot keep track of the conversations in any reasonable way in QKSMS. A recent update fixed the night mode issues I was having.,
Uniformity,this is the first app in my entire life ive seriously considered supporting devs threw buy options a MUST HAVE app. Im new to linux/UNIX based everything - this app has been a HUGE help in everyway possable. im giving 5 starts - but i do have a suggestion. I would love to see a full blown termux keyboard just for this app - just imagine functinality keys - prehaps enable swipe and voice commands(could be specific device not allowing swipe to work). prograble buttons for most used command ect ect,
Uniformity,Excellent app .It gives feeling of using actual kali terminal. But 3 suggestions: 1. Tab should work . 2. Cursor should be there if some mistake is there so I can correct it. 3. Should also include keyboard with control key tab key and arrow key. App should have extra keyboard containg tab and other keys like in JuicesSSH App.,
Uniformity," This does everything it should - and does it very well. Love that it's searchable - and that you can save favorites. Great that it's ad-free. The only improvement i could suggest would be if it was treated as a keyboard by the OS - so that you could switch to it from the ""Select Input Method"" Notification option. Otherwise - it's perfect!",
Uniformity, only keyboard I've found without enforced autospacing. best out there. Using it on LG G4 phone.,
Uniformity, When I change languages from English to Arabic in compact layout (QUERTY) it just doesn't change - 'Arabic' is displayed on the spacebar but letters are still in English,
